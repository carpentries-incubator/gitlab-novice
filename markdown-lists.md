### Markdown Lists

Lists can be represented in Markdown by starting their items with a `*`
character followed by a space. If an list item wraps over multiple lines, lines
following the first are started with sufficient spaces to align the lines text
with the first lineâ€™s text.

For example:

```
* First item
* Second item with enough text to make us wrap to a second
  line.
```
