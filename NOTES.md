## Target Audience

Answering the following questions, we characterize our target audience.

**What is the expected educational level of our audience?**

Anyone who completed school.

**What type of exposure do our audience members have to the technologies we plan
to teach?**

Our target audience regularly work with desktop computers or laptops with
graphical user interfaces. They do not regularly use the console (yet), but have
at least had a resent introduction to it.

They do not necessarily have a deep rooted understanding of the difference
between a plain text file and a binary file, but they heard about it.

They know Git or had a resent introduction to it.

**What types of tools do they already use?**

They have collaborated with others using software, like NextCloud or shared
Markdown pads over the internet.

**What are the pain points they are currently experiencing?**

They want to collaborate with colleagues on projects based on text files. Either
the technology is about to be introduced as a tool in their work groups or it is
already being used and they recently joint the group.

### Learner Profiles

The following two sections describe two learner profiles that represent the
lower and upper bound of previous knowledge that is sensible for learners of
this lesson. If someone is less knowledgeable, they might need to learn
about requirements of this lesson first, while someone that is more
knowledgeable might will not only be bored but is probably better of helping
teach lesson.
