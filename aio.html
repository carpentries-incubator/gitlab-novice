<hr class="half-width">
<p>GitLab is a web application for managing software projects. However,
the features it provides can also be used for related purposes; for
example, issue or task management, document management or project
management in general.</p>
<p>GitLab is open source software and can be run by anyone on their own
hardware. The company behind the software runs one so called instance
under <a href="https://gitlab.com" class="external-link uri">https://gitlab.com</a>
where anyone (resident in a country or territory not sanction by the
USA) can create an account and use it within certain limits for free.
But there are also instances run by diverse people and institutions from
hobbyists over small NGOs to large organizations (e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.dlr.de/" class="external-link uri">https://gitlab.dlr.de/</a>).
Those are not necessarily publicly accessible.</p>
<p>GitHub is a direct competitor to, and probably inspiration for,
GitLab. Unlike GitLab, GitHub is not open source software, but large
customers can run their own instances. With respect to the content
covered by this lesson they are very similar and only differ in details.
So, if you are already familiar with using GitHub, all this lesson can
probably teach you is how concepts already familiar to you from GitHub
are called in GitLab.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Navigate to to GitLab.comâs <a href="https://gitlab.com/user/sign_in" class="external-link">sign in page</a> and log in to
your account. Once logged in, have a look at what projects you can see
in the first three tabs (âYour projectsâ, âStarred projectsâ, and
âExplore projectsâ). Play around with the filters and sort settings.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When we log into GitLab for the first time, we are greeted by a
welcome page, offering us four ways to move forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>âCreate a projectâ</li>
<li>âCreate a groupâ</li>
<li>âExplore public projectsâ</li>
<li>âLearn more about GitLabâ</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover how to create a project and a group in the next
episode. For now, we want to learn how to navigate GitLab. For that we
select âExplore public projectsâ. This leads us to the projects overview
page. The project is the main organizational unit of GitLab.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">

</div>
<div id="homepage" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Homepage<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#callout1"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The welcome page is only shown as long as we are not a member of any
project yet. On instances other than on GitLab.com it might not be shown
at all. In the case the configured home page is shown.</p>
<p>The project overview page is the default homepage. However, the
homepage is a configuration option for GitLab instances as well as
users. You may have changed that setting and on other instances an
administrator might have done so.</p>
<p>You can always navigate to the project overview page by selecting one
of the subentries of the âProjectsâ option in the menu accessible from
the menu button on the left side of the top menu bar.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Depending on whether you have used GitLab before or have been
assigned to a group by someone else you may see some or no projects on
the first two tabs, âYour projectsâ and âStarred projectsâ. But on
GitLabâs own instance you will certainly see projects on the âExplore
projectsâ tab. For example, while writing the lesson material the tab
looked like this:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/project-list.png" alt="Project overview page with tab âExplore projectsâ and subtab âMost starsâ open. The tab shows a list of projects with icon, name, descriptions, and four statistical values for each entry." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project overview page</figcaption></figure><p>The first tab, âYour projectsâ, lists all projects that you are a
member of. When you create a project you automatically become a member
and others can add you as a member to a project. We will learn about
another way to become a member of a project in the <a href="04-groups.html">episode on groups</a>.</p>
<p>The second tab, âStarred projectsâ, lists projects that you have
âstarredâ. In this context âstarringâ it is similar to bookmarks in a
browser. Every project homepage shows a widget in the upper right corner
labeled âStarâ. By pressing it you âstarâ or bookmark the project.</p>
<p>The third tab, âExplore projectsâ, lists all projects that you can
access. This includes all projects from the âYour projectsâ tab as well
as all projects that are publicly visible.</p>
<div id="callout2" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="visiblity" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Visiblity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#callout2"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>GitLab offers three settings for the visibility of a project: public,
internal, and private. Publicly visible projects can be looked at by
anyone that can access the GitLab instance, projects with internal
visibility can be looked at by anyone logged in to the instance, while
projects with private visibility can only be locked at by its
members.</p>
<p>On GitLab.com the visibility âinternalâ is disabled. Everyone can
create an account, log in to the instance, and thus could look at any
project of internal visibility anyway.</p>
<p>Self-hosted instances might also disable some visibility types. For
example, the public visibility might be disabled, to prevent users from
publishing something to the whole internet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When working with GitLab, most of the time you will want to access
projects you are already a member of (in the GitLab sense). In that case
the list on the âYour projectsâ will be all you need to find the project
you are looking for. When the list becomes long, the search field next
to the tabs allows you to filter the projects by name, just as the
placeholder text suggests.</p>
<p>You can also use that search field on the âExplore projectsâ tab to
search through all projects that you can look at.</p>
<p>The search field in the top menu bar can also be used to find
projects. It shows other search results, too, but clearly labels what is
what.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the search field under the âProjectsâ in the
menu accessible from the menu button on the left side of the top menu
bar to search for projects.</p>

<p>The second organizational entity, next to projects, are groups.
Groups can contain projects and other groups. So groups can be used to
give structure to the organization of multiple projects. In a later
episode, when we talk about members of groups and projects, we learn
about another use for groups.</p>
<p>Groups and projects work somewhat similar to directories and files in
the file system. Every group and every project can be contained in only
one group and a group cannot contain itself.</p>
<p>To make our lives easier later on, we introduce to terms regarding a
groupâs position ins this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group not contained in another group is called <strong>top-level
group</strong>.</li>
<li>A group contain in another group is called a
<strong>subgroup</strong> of that group.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>After knowing how to find groups and projects. We want to go from
passively browsing GitLab to actively using it. We are going to create a
project and connect a local Git repository to it.</p>
<p>To create a project, click on the button with the â+â symbol in the
top menu bar and select âNew project/repositoryâ.</p>
<p>Multiple options are presented for how to create the new project. In
this lesson we will only look at, and use, the first option: âCreate
blank projectâ. So click on that.</p>
<p>This leads to the following page:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/create-project.png" alt="Create blank project form with text input fields labeled âProject nameâ, âProject URLâ, âProject slugâ, âProject description (optional)â, âProject deployment target (optional)â, a radio button element labeled âVisibility Levelâ with options âPrivateâ and âPublicâ, and two checkboxes labeled âInitialize repository with a READMEâ and âEnable Static Application Security Testing (SAST)â." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Create blank project form</figcaption></figure><p>The âProject nameâ field is for just that, the project name. Its
value has no other purpose and can be changed at anytime without
indirect consequences (the direct consequence being, that its name will
be different). We will call it âResearch Diaryâ.</p>
<p>As we fill in the project name, a project slug gets suggested in the
respective field. The project slug is the last part of the projectâs,
and the associated Git repositoryâs, URL or web address.</p>
<p>If the user belongs to at least one group, the URLâs middle part can
be chosen in the drop-down field labeled âProject URLâ, which defaults
to the current userâs username. This is the location for a userâs
project (and groups). Other options in the drop-down list are the groups
in which the current user may create projects.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="project-url-and-project-slug" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Project URL and Project Slug<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#callout1"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The two fields under labels âProject URLâ and âProject slugâ are the
only fields in this form for which changing the value later might cause
problems. Since they determine the URL under which the projectâs pages
and the projectâs Git repository can be found, changing them later might
brake links and bookmarks as well as connections from Git repositories
on other systems, for example on contributorsâ machines.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The project description appears in many lists and on some pages under
the projectâs name. We add a concise description: âMy research diary, a
collection of Markdown filesâ</p>
<div id="callout2" class="callout callout">

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Markdown is a markup language, like HTML on which the World Wide Web
is based or wikitext used to write Wikipediaâs content. Its markup
directives, indicating for example that something is a headline or a
list item, are such that they serve their purpose even in the plain text
form.</p>
<p>There exist many variants (or flavors) of Markdown and GitLab has <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html" class="external-link">its own</a>. Other
than for rendering Markdown files in repositories on its web interface,
GitLab allows for Markdown input in many of its interfaceâs text fields,
such as issue descriptions or comments.</p>
<p>This will be pointed out as we get to use these fields during the
lesson.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We ignore the field labeled âProject deployment target
(optional)â.</p>
<p>The choice of radio button under label âVisibility Levelâ determines
the projectâs visibility. As mentioned in the previous episode âFinding
Projects and Groupsâ, the visibility âInternalâ is disabled on
GitLab.com, so only âPrivateâ, the default, and âPublicâ are available.
We choose âPrivateâ.</p>
<p>If, as per default, the checkbox âInitialize repository with a
READMEâ is checked, the projectâs repository will be initialized with a
commit that adds a file called <code>README.md</code>. Otherwise, a the
project will start with an empty repository. We will be adding such a
file later ourselves, so we uncheck the box.</p>
<div id="callout3" class="callout callout">

</div>
<div id="readme" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">README<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#callout3"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A projectâs README file usually contains basic information about the
project: what it contains, how it can be used (for example build or
installed, if it is a software project), how to contribute, how to get
help, and licensing information.</p>
<p>It is common to write README files in Markdown format, indicated by
the filename suffix <code>.md</code>.</p>
<p>Platforms like GitLab show the contents of a projectâs README file on
its homepage; if it is in Markdown format, in its rendered form.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will ignore any other fields that may be visible depending on the
GitLab instances configuration.</p>
<p>After clicking the âCreate projectâ button, GitLab creates the
project and redirects us to the projectâs homepage, which looks similar
to this:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/new-project.png" alt="Project homepage for a new project. On the left, a menu leading to other project pages: Project Information, Issues, Merge requests, CI/CD, Security &amp; Compliance, Deployments, Monitor, Infrastructure, Packages &amp; Registries, Analytics, Wiki, Snippets, and Settings. On the right, taking up the major part of the width, the project page: Starting at the top, the projectâs name âResearch Diaryâ, followed by its descriptions âMy research diary, a collection of Markdown filesâ, an encouragement to âInvite your teamâ with a button âInvite membersâ, the statement that âThe repository for this project is emptyâ with various buttons for getting initial content into the repository. At the bottom, the beginning of instructions on how to push an existing repository are visible, but cut off." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Fresh project homepage</figcaption></figure><p>The page is split into the menu on the left and the project overview
on the right.</p>
<p>The menu leads to pages related to various properties, processes, and
content of the project. It is visible on each of these pages. The number
of menu entries may seem overwhelming, in particular when one notices
that the entries have subentries. However, it is not necessary to know
what hides behind all these entries to use GitLab. Following this
lesson, we will get to know parts of what lies behind the entries
âProject Informationâ, âIssuesâ, âMerge requestsâ, âCI/CDâ, âWikiâ, and
âSettingsâ.</p>
<p>The project overview shows (from the top): The projectâs avatar (or
icon), name and description; a prompt to invite team members (we will
cover members later on); a statement that our repository is currently
empty with buttons for several options to add content to it; and finally
the beginning of the instructions on how to push a local repository to
this projectâs repository to fill it with content. We will follow them
in just a bit.</p>
<p>The project overview page will look slightly different, once we have
content in its repository. We will have another look at the page
then.</p>

<p>Click on the âSettingsâ menu entry and change any of the projectâs
name, description, visibility, and avatar. Do not forget to click the
âSave changesâ button once you are done.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The project overview page presents us with many options to add
content to the projectâs repository directly in GitLab. However, we will
fill the project from a local Git repository. To do that, we need a
local Git repository with some content.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before we initialize a local Git repository, we make sure that Git is
properly configured.</p>
<p>To check for our name and email address, We run</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global --get user.name</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global --get user.email</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>If both return sensible values, we are good to go. Otherwise we
provide the missing values, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "Some Novice"
$ git config --global user.email "some.novice@example.com"</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>It is now common to name the default branch <code>main</code>, rather
than <code>master</code> as is still the default in Git. For more
information see, for example, the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/10/new-git-default-branch-name/" class="external-link">announcement
of GitLab to change the default branch</a> Since the discussion on this
topic has started, Git has introduced a configuration value for the
initial branch created by the <code>git init</code> command. We will use
this, to make sure that all future repositories created locally start
with a branch called <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code></pre>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Having thus created our local repository, we want to save it to our
repository in GitLab. To that end, we have a look at the project
overview page again; this time at the instructions toward the bottom of
the page. They read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Git global setup</strong></p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Some Novice"
git config --global user.email "some.novice@example.com"</code></pre>
<p><strong>Create a new repository</strong></p>
<pre><code>git clone https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git
cd test
git switch -c main
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "add README"
git push -u origin main</code></pre>
<p><strong>Push an existing folder</strong></p>
<pre><code>cd existing_folder
git init --initial-branch=main
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main</code></pre>
<p><strong>Push an existing Git repository</strong></p>
<pre><code>cd existing_repo
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git
git push -u origin --all
git push -u origin --tags</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We already covered the global setup.</p>
<p>The next three sets of instructions are mutually exclusive. The first
is not for us, because we already created a repository. Neither is the
second, because although we have a directory with contents, its already
a Git repository. That leaves us with the third option, which is the one
applicable to our situation: âPush an existing Git repository.â</p>
<p>Transferring our changes to a remote repository is called
<strong>push</strong>ing, because we are sending the changes from us,
the local repository, to somewhere else, a remote repository. Later on
we will â<strong>pull</strong>â changes from a remote repository,
completing the analogy.</p>
<p>Going back to the shell, we configure our projectâs repository as a
remote in our local repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<div id="callout6" class="callout callout">

<div id="https-vs-git" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">
<a href="https://" class="external-link uri">https://</a> vs
git@<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#callout6"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>We assume throughout this lesson that the user has no SSH key is
configured, because we do not want to make the setup of such a key a
prerequisite.</p>
<p>If however, a user has configured an SSH key for their account,
GitLab would default to showing links to repositories in the form for
Git over SSH instead.</p>
<p>For example, without a configured key GitLab shows</p>
<p><code>https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research.git</code></p>
<p>for our example repository, whereas with a configured key it would
show</p>
<p><code>git@gitlab.com:somenovice/research.git</code>.</p>
<p>The HTTPS link still works if a SSH key is configured, it is only no
longer shown by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We instruct Git to add a remote called <code>origin</code> with the
last part as the address. Make sure to copy that last part from the
project overview page, because it represents the Git address of your
projectâs repository on GitLab. It will be different for everyone.</p>
<p>Note also, that we skipped the second line of the instructions. It
renames an existing remote <code>origin</code> to
<code>old-origin</code>, but we have no existing remote.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Apart from following restrictions that Git puts on remote names,
which can be avoided without much thought by using only letters,
numbers, underscores, and hyphens, we should choose meaningful names for
remotes, in particular, when we add multiple remotes to a local
repository.</p>
<p>In most examples, <code>origin</code> is used as the name for a
remote, because it is the name of the remote created when cloning a
repository. It is a meaningful name for the main remote repository, if
there is one. This together with its ubiquitous use make it a very good
name.</p>
<p>In other cases, we might call a remote to a private copy of the main
repository after our username or server it is located on, for example

<p>Having successfully pushed our commit to the GitLab repository, we
change to our browser and navigate to the project (or reload it, if we
still have it open). We will be greeted by the project homepage, similar
to the following screenshot:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/first-push.png" alt="Project homepage of a project. On the left, a menu leading to other project pages. On the right, taking up most of the width, the project homepage. Starting from the top, we first have the project title, Research Diary, followed by a line of statistical values (1 Commit, 1 Branch, 0 Tags, 72KB files, 72 KB Storage). Under these we see the description: âMy research diary, a collection of Markdown filesâ. In the next line we see a drop-down field for branches showing âmainâ, the project slugÂ¸âtestâ, a drop-down button labeled â+â, and buttons labeled âHistoryâ, âFind fileâ, âWeb IDEâ, a download symbol, and âCloneâ. This is followed by a box giving information on the last commit of the current branch: the commit message âAdd README.mdâ, the authors name and how far in the past the commit was authored, as well as prefix of the commitâs hash with a copy-to-clipboard button. This is followed by some buttons that allow to add or upload new files or setup some of GitLab features for the project. Next is a list of files, in this case only `README.md`, with information when it was last updated and through which commit. Finally, we see a rendering of `README.md`." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project homepage after first push</figcaption></figure><p>Let us look at what has changed compared to its initial state. The
interface elements encouraging us to add members to the project are
gone. Of course, we can still navigate to the projectâs Members later
on, if we need to. We also, correctly, no longer get told that the
repository is empty and the instructions on how to push content to the
repository have vanished.</p>
<p>Instead, we see some statistics below the projectâs title: 1 Commit,
1 Branch, 0 Tags, 72 KB Files, 72 KB Storage. They double as buttons
other project pages.</p>
<p>Below the description is a new button bar, followed by a box
presenting information on last commit of the currently select
branch.</p>
<p>The buttons below, that we saw earlier, allow us to add specific
files or navigate to the configuration of certain GitLab features. Note
that one button changed from reading âAdd READMEâ to just âREADMEâ,
since we added <code>README.md</code>. The button is now a link to the
latest version of that file in the current branch.</p>
<p>Then we see a list of files. So far, there is only
<code>README.md</code>. The list also tells us through which commit it
was last changed and when that commit was created.</p>
<p>Finally, we see the markdown file <code>README.md</code> rendered.
Because having a README-file in the root directory of a repository is a
widespread convention, GitLab (and other platforms like it) usually
render it on a projectâs homepage.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We just went through the beginning of a GitLab projectâs life cycle.
At its end, if it has one, a project gets archived (or deleted). We will
now go through the process of archiving a project, without completing
the step.</p>
<p>Using the menu on the left, we navigate to the projects settings.</p>
<p>At the bottom the page, we find a section named âAdvancedâ. We hit
the âExpandâ button right next to it and scroll down the page.</p>
<p>Notice that many of buttons here are not the usual blue or white, but
after scrolling a little they are red. This indicates that we should be
careful about clicking them. Things might break or get deleted.</p>
<p>Scrolling back up, we find a section labeled âArchive Projectâ.
Clicking the button will not delete the project. Instead it will be
placed in a read-only mode. Everything will be preserved but nothing can
be changed anymore. In addition, the project no longer shows up in
search results and on the page for exploring projects.</p>
<p>Most of the time archiving a project is preferable to deleting it, in
particular when it comes to research projects. <strong>Do not archive
the project now! We will work with it throughout this
lesson.</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of the page is also a section for deleting a project,
in case you ever think that is the right thing to do.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>So far, each of you has created a GitLab project that no one but you
can contribute to; depending on the visibility setting, no one but you
might be able to even see it.</p>
<p>Git and GitLab can be and is used for one-person projects. But we
want our colleagues to contribute to our research diary, when they keep
tabs on our experiments for us on the weekends. To achieve this, we will
grant others access to our GitLab project.</p>
<p>Using the menu on the left side of the project homepage (or nearly
any other project page), we navigate to the project members page
hovering over or clicking on âProject Informationâ and then clicking on
âMembersâ in the submenu. The project member page should look similar to
the following screenshot:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/initial-members.png" alt="Webpage coutout titled âProject Membersâ with three buttons next to the title: âImport from a projectâ, âInvite a groupâ, and âInvite membersâ. Below a table listing the projectâs members, showing account holderâs name with account name, the membership source, when access was granted, the memberâs maximum role and the membership expiration date. The table contains one column: âPhilipp Matthias SchÃ¤fer, @fiveop, Direct member, 2 weeks ago by himself, Maintainer, and no Expiration date." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project members page</figcaption></figure><p>On the page we can see the page title, âProject membersâ, three
buttons to the left of the title, and a filterable table of members,
currently only listing ourselves.</p>
<p>The table shows our full name and account name, why we are a member
of this project, when we got accessâat the moment we created the
projectâwhat our maximum role isâmore on that in a bitâand a disabled
membership expiration date widget.</p>
<p>For practice we will all add an instructor to our project and remove
them again right away. Click the button labeled âInvite membersâ, type
in the username your instructors provided you with into the search
field, make sure that âGuestâ is selected as a role, and click the
button labeled âInviteâ.</p>
<p>After reloading the page, your instructor should now be listed next
to you in the table. Unlike in your row, you can change the role and the
expiration date of this new entry. There also is a new, red button in
this row labeled âRemove memberâ.</p>
<p>The role determines what the member is allowed to do in the project.
A maintainer has full rights, a guest almost none. GitLabâs handbook
gives a detailed <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html" class="external-link">overview</a> of
the different rolesâ permissions.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to remove the instructor from your projectâs
members again. Click the button labeled âRemove memberâ in the
instructorâs row then click the button of the same name in the popup
dialog. The page reloads itself and the entry vanishes from the
table.</p>

<p>Now, everyone should be the member of one of your co-learnersâ

<p>Now we are sure that everything is in order with the cloned

<p>In the first episode, we already got to know groups; GitLabâs way to
organize projects. A group might hold a projects of a research group or
those of a research project with contributors from multiple
institutions. Together with members and their permissions they can be
used to manage access to multiple repositories (for example, restrict
access to certain repositories to staff while others may be accessed by
student assistants as well).</p>
<p>In this episode we will create (and delete) a group, move our
project, and learn how members of a group relate to its subgroups and
projects.</p>
<section id="creating-a-group"><h2 class="section-heading">Creating a Group<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-group"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In the top menu bar, we open the drop-down menu labeled with a boxed
plus and select the menu item âNew Groupâ. On the next page, we select
âCreate groupâ, because that is what we want to do.</p>
<p>This leads to the following page:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/create-group.png" alt="Create group form with text input fields labeled âGroup nameâ, âGroup URLâ, a radio button element labeled âVisibility Levelâ with options âPrivateâ and âPublicâ, a drop-down field labeled âRoleâ, a radio button element labeled âWho will be using this group?â with options âMy company or teamâ and âJust meâ, a drop-down field labeled âWhat will you use this group for?â and an text input field labeled âEmail 1â with a button to add more under the heading âInvite members (optional)â." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Create group form</figcaption></figure><p>Choose any name for the group, for example a fictional research group
like âAnt-Sized Elephantsâ Applications Labâ. When you move the focus
out of the input field, for example by pressing the tabulator key,
GitLab will suggest a URL for the group. Usually, we might want to adapt
it, but for now all we care about that it is available.</p>
<p>You can leave the groupâs visibility private. The visibility of a
group works like that of a project.</p>
<p>We will leave the remaining fields as they are and create the group
by clicking the blue button labeled âCreate groupâ. GitLab will navigate
to the group home page, listing the groupâs subgroups and projects
(currently none).</p>
<p>Now, we will have a look at how to create a project in the new
group.</p>
<p>In the top menu bar, we open the drop-down menu labeled with a boxed
plus and select the menu item âNew Projectâ. On the next page, we select
âCreate blank projectâ.</p>
<p>This leads to the create blank project form page. We do not really
want to create a project. Instead we have a look at the drop-down field
under the heading âProject URLâ. It will either show your username or
one of the groups you belong to.</p>
<p>If the field does not show the URL of the group that we just created,
clicking on the field should open a drop-down list which includes it and
allows us to select it.</p>
<p>Submitting the form with our groupâs URL selected would create a
project in that group.</p>
</section><section id="move-project-to-group"><h2 class="section-heading">Move Project to Group<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#move-project-to-group"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We will now move our project to our group.</p>
<p>On the side menu, we select âSettingsâ then âGeneralâ. On that page,
we expand the section labeled âAdvancedâ and scroll down to the
subsection labeled âTransfer Projectâ.</p>
<p>Now, please read the subsections notes, with an emphasis on the list
of things to be aware of.</p>
<p>A few comments on the last two items of the list:</p>
<p>The second to last tells us that we will need to update our local
repositories to point to the new location. Because we are moving the
project to a group from our own projects, the URL will change. So the
URL we specified when adding the remote to our local repository will no
longer be valid. We will test this, but will not change the URL, because
we will move the project back in a bit.</p>
<p>The last item on the list informs us about potential visibility
changes. For example, moving a public project to a private group, will
cause the project to become private.</p>
<p>Having carefully read and thought about the warnings, we are ready to
move our project. We select the group that we previously created from
the drop-down field and click the button labeled âTransfer projectâ.</p>
<p>A dialog appears and we confirm, that we are sure, by typing in the
name of our project and clicking the button labeled âConfirmâ.</p>
<p>The project will be transferred to the group.</p>
<p>To test that the URL changed, we switch to the shell and navigate to
the directory containing our repository; <strong>Not the repository of
our co-learner</strong>!</p>
<p>Running</p>
<pre><code>git remote get-url origin</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>should tell us that our project points to the old project URL. So,
let us try to run</p>
<pre><code>git pull</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<pre><code>Already up to date.</code></pre>
<p>{: .output}</p>
<p>That result is unexpected. The reason for this is that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes" class="external-link">GitLab
will redirect the old URLs to the new ones, as long as the old URLs do
not point to a new project.</a></p>

member of the project. Our co-learner has the âDeveloperâ role that we
assigned them and are also a direct member of the project, as we added
them directly to the project.</p>
<p>The entry we are really interested in is that of the instructor. We
added them as a âGuestâ to the group. Now, they show up in the list of
this project with the same role. The reason is, as the column âSourceâ
tells us, that our project is in our group, and our instructor is a
member of that group.</p>
<p>That means, <strong>projects and groups inherit the members of the

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before our excursion to learn about groups, we contributed lab notes
to our co-learnerâs repository. Having done that, we think we should be
listed as contributors in the documentation of that repository. Since,
we want our co-learner to do the honors, we create an issue in their
repository, to document our desire.</p>
<p>Issues are a feature of GitLab that allows us to organize tasks by
project and by group (and its descendant groups and projects). By
default anyone that has read access to a project can file issues. This
usually makes sense, because users can report their problems and ask
their questions that way, even when they are not supposed change
anything themselves.</p>
<p>With our co-learnerâs help, we navigate to their project. On the side
bar menu on the left we click the entry labeled âIssuesâ and on the
following page we click on the button labeled âNew issueâ.</p>
<p>This leads us to the following form:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/issue.png" alt="New issue form with a text input field labeled âTitleâ with subscript âAdd description templates to help your contributors communicate effectively!â, the second and third word being a link, a drop-down field labeled âTypeâ showing the word âIssueâ, a multi-line text input field with buttons for text formatting labeled âDescriptionâ, a check box labeled âThis issue is confidential and should only be visible to team members with at least Reporter access.â, drop-down fields labeled âAssigneeâ, âMilestoneâ, and âLabelâ showing âUnassignedâ, âMilestoneâ, and âLabelsâ, respectively, a date input field labeled âDue dateâ, and two buttons labeled âCreate Issueâ and âCancelâ." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>New issue form</figcaption></figure><p>For our issue we provide a short, descriptive title, for example
âRecognize outside contributorsâ and a description:</p>
<pre><code>Outside contributors should be mentioned in the projectâs documentation. Their
names could be listed in one of the following locations:

* a section of `README.md`
* a separate `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file</code></pre>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Markdown provides syntax for formatting text in a monospaced font,
this is usually used to typeset code, because code is usually written to
be readable in such fonts.</p>
<p>For a monospaced snippet within a normal paragraph, enclose the
snippet in a single backquote (also called backtick or grave accent),
for example</p>
<pre><code>The filename `README.md` will be set in a monospaced font.</code></pre>
<p>will be typeset as:</p>
<p>The filename <code>README.md</code> will be set in a monospaced
font.</p>
<p>For a whole block of monospaced text, for example some lines of code,
start and end the block with a line consisting of three or more
backquotes, where the number should match for start and end, for
example</p>
<pre><code>```
# This python code will also be set in a monospaced font, which preserves
# relative indentation between lines.
def some_function():
    pass
```</code></pre>
<p>will be typeset as:</p>

<p>We assign the new issue to our co-learner by selecting their account
in the drop-down field labeled âAssigneeâ.</p>
<p>Then we click the button labeled âCreate issueâ. This redirects us to
the new issueâs page. Near top we see its title followed by its
description. That we created the issue is mentioned above the title. A
text field below the description can be used to create a comment and a
side bar on left lists more fields that could be used to further specify
properties of that issue.</p>
</section><section id="add-a-label"><h2 class="section-heading">Add a Label<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#add-a-label"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of those, the field labeled âLabelsâ, we will get to know,
now.</p>
<p>We want to know when our co-learner starts to work on the issue. To
communicate that fact through GitLabâs issue system we can use its Label
feature. Issues can be defined for groups and projects. In the case of
groups they are then also available to all its descendant groups and
projects.</p>
<p>So, if we want to assign a label to the issue, we first have to
create it. We click on the âEditâ link next to the âLabelâ field in the
side bar. This opens a small dialog titled âAssign labelsâ. If we had
already defined labels, they would be listed here.</p>
<p>Since have not, we click the link âCreate project labelâ in the small
dialog. A new dialog opens titled âCreate project labelâ. We call it
âWIPâ for work in progress and select our preferred color. Colors are
often used to group labels, for example one color for labels referring
to the subproject or subsystem the issue relates to, another color for
the current progress of the issue (like our WIP label), etc. Then we
click the button labeled âCreateâ.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the âAssign labelsâ dialog, this time with our
new label listed. We select our label by clicking it and close the
dialog by clicking on the x in the upper right corner.</p>
</section><section id="comment-on-an-issue"><h2 class="section-heading">Comment on an Issue<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comment-on-an-issue"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We provided a generic description of the issue in its description,
but we want to make sure that our co-learner does not forget to include
us. We intend to write a comment regarding our inclusion.</p>
<p>To support our case we want to reference our contribution. For this,
we can use another feature of GitLabâs markdown: When we mention a
commit of the projectâs repository by its identifier, GitLab will
automatically convert it to a link to the page of the commit.</p>
<p>We navigate to the projectâs commit history by clicking the submenu
item âCommitsâ of the menu item âRepositoryâ in the side menu. There we
find our commit at the top with its short identifier shown on the right.
Right next to that short identifier is a button with an icon that looks
like a clipboard. As its tooltip tells us, clicking it will copy the
commit SHA (identifier). So, we click on the button.</p>
<p>We navigate back to our issue by clicking the menu item âIssuesâ in
the side menu and clicking on the title of our issue in the opened
list.</p>
<p>Using the copied commit identifier, we formulate our commit similar
to</p>
<pre><code>Please mention me as a contributor due to commit
4eac24cafbcebc4f0d528bd2e1246a4624265085.</code></pre>
<p>and click the button labeled âCommentâ. We notice, that GitLab uses
and shortened version of the commits identifier for the link text, which
makes it slightly more readable.</p>
<p>Before we move on, please note the button labeled âClose issueâ under
the comment text field. An issue starts in the open state and can be
closed by clicking this button. When we type something into the comment
field the label of the button changes to âComment &amp; close issueâ, so
we can add a final comment before closing the issue.</p>
<p>This is a very important feature, allowing us to distinguish between
issues that have yet to be dealt with and those that have already been
dealt with. We do not, in general, delete issues, because they are often
useful to check whether a certain issue was already discussed or has
already come up in the past.</p>
</section><section id="issue-boards"><h2 class="section-heading">Issue Boards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#issue-boards"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, we will have a look at boards, a feature that uses labels to
visually organize a projectâs issues.</p>
<p>We navigate to our projectâs issue board by clicking the submenu item
âBoardsâ of the menu item âIssuesâ in the side menu.</p>
<p>The following page loads:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/board.png" alt="Issue board page with a menu bar on the left and content on the right. At the top of the content area is a drop-down field with âDevelopmentâ selected followed by a button labeled âNew boardâ a search field, a check box labeled âShow labelsâ, and two buttons the first labeled âEdit boardâ, the second âCreate listâ. Below these elements are two columns, each with a title bar, one titled âOpenâ, the other âClosedâ. In the âOpenâ column there is a box representing an issue, showing its title âRecognize outside contributorsâ, a label âWIPâ, the issue number â#1â and an avatar of a user." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Issue board page</figcaption></figure><p>GitLab creates on board, called âDevelopmentâ, by default for each
project. This is the board we see. It has two so called lists
configured, labeled âOpenâ and âClosedâ, that list all open and closed
issues of the project, respectively. These two lists cannot be
deleted.</p>
<p>We will now create another list for issues that are work in progress,
that is those that are labeled âWIPâ.</p>
<p>We click on the button labeled âCreate Listâ. A new list appears to
the right of the âClosedâ list. We are prompted to select a label. We
select our label âWIPâ and click the button labeled âAdd to boardâ.</p>
<p>The new list is created between the âOpenâ and âClosedâ lists. Those
two will always be on the left and right end, respectively. We can
reorder the lists created by us however we want between these two.</p>
<p>Note, that our issue is initially show in the âOpenâ and our new
list. When we reload the page, it disappears from the âOpenâ list. In
general, open issues that belong to one of the lists due to their labels
will not appear in the âOpenâ list. Closed issues, however, will always
only appear in the âClosedâ list.</p>
<p>Boards can not only be used to get an overview of a projectâs issues.
They can also be used to manipulate their labels. If we drag an issue
from one list to another, the label of the originating list will be
removed and that of the target list will be added (unless it is one of
the âOpenâ and âClosedâ lists). Moving an issue to the âClosedâ list
will close the issue, while moving an issue out of the âClosedâ list
will open it.</p>
<p>We note that we added the âWIPâ label to our issue, however, that is
not accurate. Our co-learner should add the label whenever they start to
work on it. To remove the label we drag the issue to the âOpenâ
list.</p>
<p>We click on the issueâs title to navigate to its page. Initially the
comment text field was directly under the description. By now, there is
a list that chronicles the changes to the issue. It starts with the
assignment to our co-learner (still from creating the issue), next we
see that the âWIPâ label was added by us, then comes our comment, and
finally it lists that we removed the âWIPâ label again.</p>
<p>This helps keep track of who did what with an issue</p>

<p>In the chapter on collaboration we learned how to contribute changes
to a project that we are a member of. We also learned, in the previous
chapter, that we can contribute to other projects by filing issues to
report problems or ask questions. This episode we will learn about a way
to suggest concrete changes to a GitLab project that we do not have
write access on.</p>
<p>The feature that allows us to do this is called Merge Request, the
corresponding feature on GitHub is called Pull Request. As a target for
our merge request, we will use our co-learners repository. We we have
write access to it, but to learn something new, we will pretend that we
donât.</p>
<p>We will create a merge request that adds a file listing the
contributors, which will solve the issue that we filed during the last
episode.</p>
<section id="create-a-fork"><h2 class="section-heading">Create a Fork<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-fork"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Since we are a member of our co-learnerâs project we could create a
merge request within the project. But again, to learn how to do it for
projectâs of which we are not a member of, we will make ourselves some
extra work.</p>
<p>So supposedly, we cannot make changes to our co-learnerâs project. We
need a copy that we can change. Such a copy is called a fork in GitLabâs
(and also GitHubâs case). The term can be explained by looking at its
use in âfork in the roadâ. Once we make changes to our copy, the
development history will have split.</p>
<p>To create a fork, we navigate to the homepage of our co-learnerâs
project. In the upper right corner is a button labeled âForkâ. The
number next to it tells us how many forks of this repository exist on
GitLab. We will now increase that number by one by clicking on the
button.</p>
<p>This redirects us to a form that looks like a reduced version of the
âCreate new projectâ form. Since we do not want to make a real fork of
the project, that is project that develops in a different direction than
the original, but rather suggest a change to the original, we will leave
almost everything as it is.</p>
<p>What we need to do is select a namespace. We will use our user
namespace, so we select ourselves in the drop-down list under âProject
URLâ. We set the visibility to private, because we will make the changes
public (to those able to see the original project) once we create the
merge request. Then we click the âFork projectâ button.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>If there already is a project with the name or the same slug, GitLab
will show you an error message which, at the time of me writing this,
can be summarized to âan error has occurredâ, which is not very helpful.
In that case, reload the page, select a different name and/or slug and
try again.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We are redirected to the forkâs project home page. The fork is full
featured project just like the original, however, only the Git
repository is copied. So, for example, there are no issues in it, even
though the original had at least one.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Our goal is to create a file listing contributors to the project. We
will do this within GitLab using its file creation and editing
features.</p>
<p>To do that, we click on the button labeled âWeb IDEâ in the line just
below the projectâs description. This redirects us to a page with a file
browser in a column on the, with most of the screen taken up by a box
informing us how to use the Web IDE: âSelect a file from the left
sidebar to begin editing. Afterwards, youâll be able to commit your
changes.â</p>
<p>We do not want to edit an existing file, but want to create a new
one. To do that we click on the button above the list of files on the
left that is marked with an icon representing a sheet of paper with a
+-sign on top of it.</p>
<p>A pop-up dialog prompts us for a name, which we will provide:
âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ followed by clicking the button labeled âCreate
fileâ.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In software projects it is customary to name certain files with
information about a project in all caps. One example we already
encountered is the README file. Others are the file containing the
license (<code>LICENSE</code>), a file about how to contribute
(<code>CONTRIBUTING</code>), or how to install the software
(<code>INSTALL</code>).</p>
<p>Sometimes a file extension indicating the format is appended, usually
in lower-case letters.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We see the result of our action in two ways: A file named
âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ appeared in the list of files on the left and a tab
labeled âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ showing an text editor appeared in the space
to the right of the list of files.</p>
<p>We will now add something similar the following lines in the
editor:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">MARKDOWN<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ss">- </span>Conner Learner</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Then we click the button labeled âCreate a commitâ. The view to the
left of the list of files gets split into to columns. On the left side
we see the old version of the file (it did not exist, so nothing is
shown) and on the right side we see the new version with additions
marked in green. If we had removed anything from the old version those
lines would have been marked red on the left side.</p>
<p>Since everything looks as expectedâone new file with called
âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ with the lines we just typed inâwe change the commit
message to</p>
<pre><code>Add CONTRIBUTORS.md</code></pre>
<p>We keep âCreate a new branchâ with the pre-generated name selected.
For our purposes we could also leave the checkbox âStart a new merge
requestâ selected, but we want to go through the merge request creation
process separately to get familiar with it, in case we want to create
one from changes we pushed from a local repository.</p>
<p>We do create a new branch and do not commit the changes to the branch
called âmainâ, because it is a good habit. We might want to create
multiple independent merge requests for one project, which cannot be
done from a single branch. And then there is the option to create merge
requests within a project, those cannot come from the branch they are
supposed to be merged to, so we need another branch anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, we click the button labeled âCommitâ.</p>

<p>Having created the commit, we navigate back to the project home page
by clicking on the projectâs name in the upper left corner.</p>
<p>We notice that the file that we created is not present in the list of
files. This is because GitLab shows the default branch, in our case the
branch called âmainâ, by default. When we click the drop-down field
below the description and the sentence starting with âForked fromâ¦â, we
get shown a list of all branches, which should be two: âmainâ and the
one generated for our change, something along the lines of
ââ¦-patch-12345â. We select the new branch and now the file
âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ shows up in the list of files.</p>
<p>To create a merge request, we click on the menu item labeled âMerge
requestsâ in the menu on the left and on the following page on the
button labeled âNew merge requestâ.</p>
<p>This gets us to the following dialog:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/merge-request.png" alt="New merge request page. On the left, a menu leading to other project pages. ON the right, taking up the major part of the width, the new merge request page: Below the page title, there are two UI elements side-by-side. The one on the left, titled âSource branchâ, has two drop-down fields, one to select the project, the other to select the branch. The former reads âfiveop/research-diary-2â, the latter âSelect source branchâ. The one on the right, titled âTarget branchâ, has the same two drop-down fields. In this case the former reads âsomenovice/research-diaryâ and the latter âmainâ. Belowthe two drop-down fields there is a box with information about the last commit on the âmainâ branch: message, author, relative author date and short identifier." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>New merge request page</figcaption></figure><p>On the left side, we select the branch generated for our change. Once
done, a box with details of the last commit on that branch appears below
the drop-down fields on the left.</p>
<p>We click the button labeled âCompare branches and continueâ. On the
following page, we can see that a merge request has itâs own title and
description. They are prefilled with the newest commit message of the
source branch. To connect this merge request with the issue we filed, we
write</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">Resolves</span> <span class="co">#1</span></span></code></pre>
<p>in the merge request description. Everything else, we leave with its
default value or in its default state, including the two checkboxes.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Whenever a merge request is merged to the default branch of a project
and its description or the description of a commit it contains the
phrase <code>&lt;keyword&gt; #&lt;number&gt;</code> for one of the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#default-closing-pattern" class="external-link">keywords
mentioned in GitLabâs documentation</a>, then the issue with number
<code>&lt;number&gt;</code> is closed automatically.</p>
<p>This can save a few clicks and ensures that closing the issue will
not be forgotten.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first, labeled âDelete source branch when merge request is
acceptedâ, is selected and thus letâs GitLab clean up after us; we no
longer need the branch once it has been merged.</p>
<p>The second, labeled âSquash commits when merge request is acceptedâ,
is not selected. If it were, GitLab would merge all commits of the merge
request, that is all commits on the source branch since it was branched
off the target branch, into one commit before merging. In our case,
there is only one commit, so it would serve no purpose.</p>
<p>We click the button labeled âCreate merge requestâ. This leads us to
the page for the created merge request. It looks similar to the page for
an issue. The main difference are the tabs, their headers being located
just below the title: âOverviewâ (the one that is shown initially),
âCommitsâ, and âChangesâ.</p>
<p>Clicking on the tab header labeled âCommitsâ, we see a list of all
the commits of this merge request, which in our case is the commit we
created.</p>
<p>Clicking on the tab header labeled âChangesâ, we see a so called diff
for each of the changed files. In our case a file was added, so all the
lines in the file are new, indicated by the plus sign at the beginning
of each line.</p>
<p>Back on the âOverviewâ tab, below the description there is a
technical description of the merge request, starting with âRequest to
mergeâ¦â, followed by a button to âApproveâ the merge request. By default
this is optional, a project can be configured to require approval by a
certain group of members for a merge request to be possible. Then there
is a grayed-out button labeled âMergeâ, followed by text that we need to
ask someone with write access to click it. We will do exactly that in a
moment. Note also, that the box around it mentions that the merge
request mentions the issue. This can be easily overlooked, if the
mention happens in a commit message of the merge request.</p>
<p>Finally at the bottom, we see that a merge request can be commented
on, just like an issue. But for merge request there is more. Navigating
to the âChangesâ tab and hovering the mouse over a line number, we see a
speech bubble button appear at the start of the line. When we press it,
a text field for a comment appears. We can use that to comment on
individual lines. This feature allows to separate discussions of
different changes of a merge request.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Being able to comment on individual lines is a useful feature for a
practice called code review. Code review entails that a peer of the
author of some changes reviews those, before they are merged. This
practice is the origin of the merge request feature, but it lends itself
well to reviewing text based changes other than to code.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>While we were creating the merge request for our co-learnerâs
repository, they did the same for ours. Now it is time to review and
accept the change.</p>
<p>Navigate to the issue your co-learner created in your repository. At
the very bottom of the issueâs history you will see en entry of the form
âCo-learner <span class="citation">@colearner</span> mentioned in merge
request !1 2 minutes agoâ. The merge request reference, â!1â, is a link.
We follow the link by clicking on it.</p>
<p>This leads us to the merge request page, very similar to the page of
our own merge request. The difference, that we are interested in, is the
state of the button labeled âMergeâ. The button is no longer disabled.
Under the button is a bar that informs us that one commit and one merge
commit will be added.</p>
<p>The merge commit serves as a common descendant of the heads of your
main branch and the branch on which your co-learner based their merge
request. We can change the commit message of the merge commit, by
clicking on the bar informing us about the number of added commits, but
we are happy with its contents.</p>
<p>We click on the button labeled âMergeâ. After a few seconds the box
that allowed us to merge is replaced by a box that informs us about the
successful merge.</p>
<p>In particular, there still is a sentence informing us that the merge
request mentions an issue. Our intention was for that issue to be
closed, so we click on the issue reference, for example â#1â, to
check.</p>
<p>On the issue page, we can see that indeed the issue was closed. The
last entry in the issueâs history reads similar to âCo-learner closed
via commit abcdef12 just nowâ, informing us why the issue was
closed.</p>

<p>We have setup our project, collaborated with our colleagues; we fill
our research diary every day. Now it is time to make use of it.</p>
<p>We think about using part of our daily commute by train to review
what happened in the past. We always have our e-reader with us, so
ideally we would like to have an version of our diary in EPUB
format.</p>
<p>Just as much based in reality as the rest of this lessonâs story, we
know how to do that, but we do not want to do it by hand. Instead, we
are going to let GitLab automatically build us an EPUB file, whenever
our repository changes. To achieve it, we will us the feature that
GitLab files under âCI/CDâ, which stands for Continuous
Integration/Continuous Deployment.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The terms continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)
come from the fields of software engineering and software operation.</p>
<p>A software project uses CI, if it has setup a process that
automatically runs some (or all) tests for a software project, whenever
changes are committed or even just proposed (for example through a merge
request) to the main branch of a repository. In particular when already
done for proposed changes this can help prevent bugs to reach the code
base, while freeing the developer of thinking of and running all the
tests themselves.</p>
<p>CD is a process that updates the software on the production machines
(deploys) as soon as a new change reaches the code base, generally after
having passed the CI process.</p>
<p>Both processes can be implemented by running scripts, called jobs,
triggered either by changes to the code base or by the successful
completion of other jobs, which lead to the CI/CD feature of GitLab.</p>

<section id="example-configuration"><h2 class="section-heading">Example Configuration<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-configuration"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To configure our automatic process, we navigate to our project page
and click the menu item labeled âCI/CDâ in the main menu on the
left.</p>
<p>The page that this leads to invites us to âuse a sample
<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> template file to explore how CI/CD works.â
The GitLab CI is configured by providing a file called
<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> in the root directory of a projectâs
repository. Even though we want to learn how CI works in GitLab, we do
not follow the invitation, because the example is quite elaborate and
targets software developers specifically. Instead, we will use the
provided template for Bash.</p>
<p>We click on the button labeled âUse templateâ of the entry for Bash
in the list at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>This leads us to an editor for the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file
that is prefilled from the selected template. The file is expected to be
written in the <a href="https://yaml.org/" class="external-link">YAML</a> file format, hence
the file extension <code>.yml</code>. We will go through the example
line by line. Afterwards we will adapt it to our needs.</p>
<p>The first few lines, starting with the symbol <code>#</code>, are
comments notifying us of where to find further information. The last of
these lines is the exception, which is a comment on the first functional
line:</p>

</div>
<p>This line states that the scripts that are provided later on should
be executed in Docker containers build from the stated Docker image.
Busybox is a very small Linux distribution, reduced to the bare minimum,
and it provides a shell.</p>

</div>
<p>Now follow to blocks starting with <code>before_script:</code> and
<code>after_script:</code>. We will ignore those.</p>
<p>The remaining four blocks, <code>build1:</code>, <code>test1:</code>,
<code>test2:</code>, and <code>deploy1:</code>, each define a so called
job. A job defines a script and represents one non-divisible unit of a
CI/CD process. Together the jobs defined in a projectâs
<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file form a so called pipeline.</p>
<p>By default a pipeline has three stages, called <code>build</code>,
<code>test</code>, and <code>deploy</code>, and their order is
important. The terminology comes from software development again. A
pipeline is executed by running all jobs of the first stage and if they
succeed to continue onto the next stage, continuing until a job fails or
all jobs of the last stage succeeded.</p>
<p>The four jobs in the example are named similar to the stages they are
assigned to. The assignment is done through the keyword
<code>stage:</code> that can always be found in the second line of a
jobâs definition.</p>
<p>The lines following the keyword <code>script:</code> in each section,
define the script that will be executed as part of the respective job.
In this example, they are all <code>echo</code> statements.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We will now adapt the script to our requirements.</p>
<p>First we delete everything.</p>
<p>Then we define our own stages, because we do not develop software and
want to have descriptive names for our use case:</p>

</div>
<p>In the first stage, we will do some testing, in the second we will
create an EPUB format version of our research diary.</p>
<p>We call the first job <code>check-for-mds</code> and in it make sure,
that at least one Markdown file exists, because otherwise someone must
have accidentally removed them all.</p>

<p>We use the docker image <code>bash</code>, because Bash provides the
<code>compgen</code> command that allows us to check for the existence
of files. We also state that the job belongs to the stage
<code>check</code>. Finally, we provide the script. It tests for the
existence of any files with names ending in <code>.md</code>.</p>
<p>Whenever the job <code>check-for-mds</code> successfully completes,
we want to create the EPUB format version of our research diary. We
define a second job and call it <code>create-epub</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>After giving the name of the job, we again provide an Docker image in
which the job should run. Since we want to use pandoc to convert our
Markdown files into an EPUB file, we use the official pandoc Docker
image. The next line, with the keyword <code>entrypoint</code> is
necessary, because the pandoc Docker image is configured to directly run
pandoc, when started in a container (pandoc is configured as its
entrypoint). However, GitLab CI expects to run scripts in the Docker
container, thus expects the Docker images to start a shell.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Pandoc converts text documents from format to another, for example

<p>The <a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">project webpage</a> provides a
complete list (in text and graphical form).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next, we specify the stage, followed by the script. It runs pandoc on
all files ending in <code>.md</code> in the current directory and
instructs it to output a file <code>diary.epub</code>. Pandoc deduces
from the file extension that it should be in EPUB format.</p>
<p>The final three lines, starting with the keyword
<code>artifacts</code>, specify that GitLab CI should save the file
<code>diary.epub</code> from the Docker container the job runs in and
provide it for download on its web interface.</p>
<p>This completes our GitLab CI configuration.There are a lot more
configuration options, for example to have a process run only for
commits to certain branches, that are documented in <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html" class="external-link">GitLabâs

<p>The software that runs CI jobs is called a runner. GitLab provides so
called shared runners on its platform for free (within certain usage
limits). It does, however, require the user to provide credit card
information. This is intended to prevent abuse of the free resource.</p>
<p>If no such information has been provided running the CI will always
fail.</p>

<p>Clicking the button does not cause a change in page. Instead, we are
informed at the top of the page about the status of the pipeline run
that was initiated by committing the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> to the
repository.</p>
<p>To get a better overview, we select âCI/CDâ from the main menu on the
right side. This brings us to the list of pipeline runs. We should see
exactly one entry in the list, as we have just configured the CI.</p>
<p>A blue, red, or green box in the âStatusâ column informs on the left
informs us about the state of the pipeline. Blue indicates a running
pipeline, red a failed pipeline, and green a pipeline that successfully
completed. Below the status box we have the runtime of the pipeline and
below that information about when it was started.</p>
<p>In the âPipelineâ column, we see the first line of the commit that
triggered the pipeline run, the number of the pipeline run, for example
<code>#11071</code>, the branch the commit is part of as well as the
short identifier of the commit. Most of these serve as links to pages
for their respective entities.</p>
<p>The âTriggererâ column tells us who caused the pipeline run. In our
case thatâs the author of the commit.</p>
<p>The âStagesâ column visualizes the stages and their state. In
addition to the colors discussed above, there are stages colored in
grey. They are waiting for their predecessor stages (or need to be
manually triggered, if configured that way).</p>
<p>We wait until our pipeline ran through. It should complete without
error.</p>

<p>We click on the button labeled by the three dots on the right of the
entry. In the menu that opens, we see that it provides a link to
download artifacts of the pipeline. We click on the link labeled
âcreate-epub:archiveâ, which causes our browser to download a file
called <code>artifacts.zip</code>.</p>
<p>In that archive, we find the file <code>diary.epub</code> that was
build by our second job, <code>create-epub</code>.</p>
<p>If you have an ebook viewer, you can verify that it contains the
contents of all Markdown our files. (We ignore the fact, that the order
might not make sense at all. For that we would need to improve the
script that builds the EPUB file.)</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
  </script>
