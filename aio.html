<hr class="half-width">
<p>GitLab is a web application for managing software projects. However, the features it provides can also be used for related purposes; for example, issue or task management, document management or project management in general.</p>
<p>GitLab is open source software and can be run by anyone on their own hardware. The company behind the software runs one so called instance under <a href="https://gitlab.com" class="external-link uri">https://gitlab.com</a> where anyone (resident in a country or territory not sanction by the USA) can create an account and use it within certain limits for free. But there are also instances run by diverse people and institutions from hobbyists over small NGOs to large organizations (e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.dlr.de/" class="external-link uri">https://gitlab.dlr.de/</a>). Those are not necessarily publicly accessible.</p>
<p>GitHub is a direct competitor to, and probably inspiration for, GitLab. Unlike GitLab, GitHub is not open source software, but large customers can run their own instances. With respect to the content covered by this lesson they are very similar and only differ in details. So, if you are already familiar with using GitHub, all this lesson can probably teach you is how concepts already familiar to you from GitHub are called in GitLab.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Log in to GitLab</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Navigate to to GitLab.com’s <a href="https://gitlab.com/user/sign_in" class="external-link">sign in page</a> and log in to your account. Once logged in, have a look at what projects you can see in the first three tabs (“Your projects”, “Starred projects”, and “Explore projects”). Play around with the filters and sort settings.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When we log into GitLab for the first time, we are greeted by a welcome page, offering us four ways to move forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Create a project”</li>
<li>“Create a group”</li>
<li>“Explore public projects”</li>
<li>“Learn more about GitLab”</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover how to create a project and a group in the next episode. For now, we want to learn how to navigate GitLab. For that we select “Explore public projects”. This leads us to the projects overview page. The project is the main organizational unit of GitLab.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="homepage" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Homepage</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The welcome page is only shown as long as we are not a member of any project yet. On instances other than on GitLab.com it might not be shown at all. In the case the configured home page is shown.</p>
<p>The project overview page is the default homepage. However, the homepage is a configuration option for GitLab instances as well as users. You may have changed that setting and on other instances an administrator might have done so.</p>
<p>You can always navigate to the project overview page by selecting one of the subentries of the “Projects” option in the menu accessible from the menu button on the left side of the top menu bar.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Depending on whether you have used GitLab before or have been assigned to a group by someone else you may see some or no projects on the first two tabs, “Your projects” and “Starred projects”. But on GitLab’s own instance you will certainly see projects on the “Explore projects” tab. For example, while writing the lesson material the tab looked like this:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/project-list.png" alt="Project overview page with tab “Explore projects” and subtab “Most stars” open. The tab shows a list of projects with icon, name, descriptions, and four statistical values for each entry." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project overview page</figcaption></figure><p>The first tab, “Your projects”, lists all projects that you are a member of. When you create a project you automatically become a member and others can add you as a member to a project. We will learn about another way to become a member of a project in the <a href="04-groups.html">episode on groups</a>.</p>
<p>The second tab, “Starred projects”, lists projects that you have “starred”. In this context “starring” it is akin to bookmarks in a browser. Every project homepage shows a widget in the upper right corner labeled “Star”. By pressing it you “star” or bookmark the project.</p>
<p>The third tab, “Explore projects”, lists all projects that you can access. This includes all projects from the “Your projects” tab as well as all projects that are publicly visible.</p>
<div id="callout2" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="visiblity" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Visiblity</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>GitLab offers three settings for the visibility of a project: public, internal, and private. Publicly visible projects can be looked at by anyone that can access the GitLab instance, projects with internal visibility can be looked at by anyone logged in to the instance, while projects with private visibility can only be locked at by its members.</p>
<p>On GitLab.com the visibility “internal” is disabled. Everyone can create an account, log in to the instance, and thus could look at any project of internal visibility anyway.</p>
<p>Self-hosted instances might also disable some visibility types. For example, the public visibility might be disabled, to prevent users from publishing something to whole internet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When working with GitLab, most of the time you will want to access projects you are already a member of. In that case the list on the “Your projects” will be all you need to find the project you are looking for. When the list becomes long, the search field next to the tabs allows you to filter the projects by name, just as the placeholder text suggests.</p>
<p>You can also use that search field on the “Explore projects” tab to search through all projects that you can look at.</p>
<p>The search field in the top menu bar can also be used to find projects. It also shows other search results, but clearly labels what is what.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the search field under the “Projects” in the menu accessible from the menu button on the left side of the top menu bar to search for projects.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The second organizational entity, next to projects, are groups. Groups can contain projects and other groups. So groups can be used to give structure to the organization of multiple projects. In a later episode, when we talk about members of groups and projects, we learn about another use for groups.</p>
<p>Groups and projects work somewhat similar to directories and files in the file system. Every group and every project can be contained in only one group and a group cannot contain itself.</p>
<p>To make our lives easier later on, we introduce to terms regarding a group’s position ins this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group not contained in another group is called <strong>top-level group</strong>.</li>
<li>A group contain in another group is called a <strong>subgroup</strong> of that group.</li>

<p>Similar as for projects, GitLab provides an overview page for groups. You can navigate there by selecting “Groups” and then “Your groups” or “Explore groups” in the menu accessible from the menu button on the left side of the top menu bar.</p>
<p>The two tabs on that page, “Your groups” and “Explore public groups” work analogously to their corresponding tabs on the project overview page discussed above.</p>
<p>For finding groups there are analogous search options as mentioned for projects before.</p>

<section id="creating-a-project"><h2 class="section-heading">Creating a Project</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>After knowing how to find groups and projects. We want to go from passively browsing GitLab to actively using it. We are going to create a project and connect a local Git repository to it.</p>
<p>To create a project, click on the button with the “+” symbol in the top menu bar and select “New project/repository”.</p>
<p>Multiple options are presented for how to create the new project. In this lesson we will only look at, and use, the first option: “Create blank project”. So click on that.</p>
<p>This leads to the following page:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/create-project.png" alt="Create blank project form with text input fields labeled “Project name”, “Project URL”, “Project slug”, “Project description (optional)”, “Project deployment target (optional)”, a radio button element labeled “Visibility Level” with options “Private” and “Public”, and two checkboxes labeled “Initialize repository with a README” and “Enable Static Application Security Testing (SAST)”." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Create blank project form</figcaption></figure><p>The “Project name” field is for just that, the project name. Its value has no other purpose and can be changed at anytime without indirect consequences (the direct consequence being, that its name will be different). We will call it “Research Diary”.</p>
<p>As we fill in the project name, a project slug gets suggested in the respective field. The project slug is the last part of the project’s, and the associated Git repository’s, URL or web address.</p>
<p>If the user belongs to at least one group, the URL’s middle part can be chosen in the drop-down field labeled “Project URL”, which defaults to the current user’s username. This is the location for a user’s project (and groups). Other options in the drop-down list are the groups in which the current user may create projects.</p>
<div id="callout1" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="project-url-and-project-slug" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Project URL and Project Slug</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The two fields under labels “Project URL” and “Project slug” are the only fields in this form for which changing the value later might cause problems. Since they determine the URL under which the project’s pages and the project’s Git repository can be found, changing them later might brake links and bookmarks as well as connections from Git repositories on other systems, for example on contributors’ machines.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The project description appears in many lists and on some pages under the project’s name. We add a concise description: “My research diary, a collection of Markdown files”</p>
<div id="callout2" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="markdown" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Markdown</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Markdown is a markup language, like HTML on which the World Wide Web is based, whose markup directives, indicating for example that something is a headline or a list item, are such that they serve their purpose even in the plain text form.</p>
<p>There exist many variants (or flavors) of Markdown and GitLab has <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html" class="external-link">its own</a>. Other than for rendering Markdown files in repositories on its web interface, GitLab allows for Markdown input in many of its interface’s text fields, such as issue descriptions or comments.</p>
<p>This will be pointed out as we get to use these fields during the lesson.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We ignore the field labeled “Project deployment target (optional)”.</p>
<p>The choice of radio button under label “Visibility Level” determines the project’s visibility. As mentioned in the previous episode “Finding Projects and Groups”, the visibility “Internal” is disabled on GitLab.com, so only “Private”, the default, and “Public” are available. We choose “Private”.</p>
<p>If, as per default, the checkbox “Initialize repository with a README” is checked, the project’s repository will be initialized with a commit that adds a file called <code>README.md</code>. Otherwise, a the project will start with an empty repository. We will be adding such a file later ourselves, so we uncheck the box.</p>
<div id="callout3" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="readme" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">README</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A project’s README file usually contains basic information about the project: what it contains, how it can be used (for example build or installed, if it is a software project), how to contribute, how to get help, and licensing information.</p>
<p>It is common to write README files in Markdown format, indicated by the filename suffix <code>.md</code>.</p>
<p>Platforms like GitLab show the contents of project’s README file on its homepage; if it is in Markdown format, in its rendered form.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will ignore any other fields that may be visible depending on the GitLab instances configuration.</p>
<p>After clicking the “Create project” button, GitLab creates the project and redirects us to the project’s homepage, which looks similar to this:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/new-project.png" alt="Project homepage for a new project. On the left, a menu leading to other project pages: Project Information, Issues, Merge requests, CI/CD, Security &amp; Compliance, Deployments, Monitor, Infrastructure, Packages &amp; Registries, Analytics, Wiki, Snippets, and Settings. On the right, taking the major port of the width, the project page: Starting at the top, the project’s name “Research Diary“, followed by its descriptions “My research diary, a collection of Markdown files”, an encouragement to “Invite your team” with a button “Invite members”, the statement that “The repository for this project is empty” with various buttons for getting initial content into the repository. At the bottom, the beginning of instructions on how to push an existing repository are visible, but cut off." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Fresh project homepage</figcaption></figure><p>The page is split into the menu on the left and the project overview on the right.</p>
<p>The menu leads to pages related to various properties, processes, and content of the project. It is visible on each of these pages. The number of menu entries may seem overwhelming, in particular when one notices that the entries have subentries. However, it is not necessary to know what hides behind all these entries to use GitLab. Following this lesson, we will get to know parts of what lies behind the entries “Project Information”, “Issues”, “Merge requests”, “CI/CD”, “Wiki”, and “Settings”.</p>
<p>The project overview shows (from the top): The project’s avatar (or icon), name and description; a prompt to invite team members (we will cover members later on); a statement that our repository is currently empty with buttons for several options to add content to it; and finally the beginning of the instructions on how to push a local repository to this project’s repository to fill it with content. We will follow them in just a bit.</p>
<p>The project overview page will look slightly different, once we have content in its repository. We will have another look at the page then.</p>
<div id="callout4" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="change-name-description-visibility-or-avatar" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Change Name, Description, Visibility, or Avatar</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Click on the “Settings” menu entry and change any of the project’s name, description, visibility, and avatar. Do not forget to click the “Save changes” button once you are done.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The project overview page presents us with many options to add content to the project’s repository directly in GitLab. However, we will fill the project from a local Git repository. To do that, we need a local Git repository with some content.</p>
</section><section id="configuring-git"><h2 class="section-heading">Configuring Git</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before we initialize a local Git repository, we make sure that Git is properly configured.</p>
<p>To check for our name and email address, We run</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global --get user.name</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global --get user.email</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>If both return sensible values, we are good to go. Otherwise we provide the missing values, for example:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global user.name "Some Novice"
$ git config --global user.email "some.novice@example.com"</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>It is now common to name the default branch <code>main</code>, rather than <code>master</code> as is still the default in Git. For more information see, for example, the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/10/new-git-default-branch-name/" class="external-link">announcement of GitLab to change the default branch</a> Since the discussion on this topic has started, Git has introduced a configuration value for the initial branch created by the <code>git init</code> command. We will use this, to make sure that all future repositories created locally start with a branch called <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main</code></pre>

<pre><code><span class="va">README.md</span></code></pre>
<p>{: .output}</p>
</section><section id="connecting-local-and-remote-repository"><h2 class="section-heading">Connecting Local and Remote Repository</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Having thus created our local repository, we want to save it to our repository in GitLab. To that end, we have a look at the project overview page again; this time at the instructions toward the bottom of the page. They read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Git global setup</strong></p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Some Novice"
git config --global user.email "some.novice@example.com"</code></pre>
<p><strong>Create a new repository</strong></p>
<pre><code>git clone https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git
cd test
git switch -c main
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "add README"
git push -u origin main</code></pre>
<p><strong>Push an existing folder</strong></p>
<pre><code>cd existing_folder
git init --initial-branch=main
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main</code></pre>
<p><strong>Push an existing Git repository</strong></p>
<pre><code>cd existing_repo
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git
git push -u origin --all
git push -u origin --tags</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We already covered the global setup.</p>
<p>The next three sets of instructions are mutually exclusive. The first is not for us, because we already created a repository. Neither is the second, because although we have a directory with contents, its already a Git repository. That leaves us with the third option, which is the one applicable to our situation: “Push an existing Git repository.”</p>
<p>Transferring our changes to a remote repository is called <strong>push</strong>ing, because we are sending the changes from us, the local repository, to somewhere else, a remote repository. Later on we will “<strong>pull</strong>” changes from a remote repository, completing the analogy.</p>
<p>Going back to the shell, we configure our project’s repository as a remote in our local repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<div id="callout6" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="https-vs-git" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">
<a href="https://" class="external-link uri">https://</a> vs git@</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>We assume throughout this lesson that the user has no SSH key is configured, because we do not want to make the setup of such a key a prerequisite.</p>
<p>If however, a user has configured an SSH key for their account, GitLab would default to showing links to repositories in the form for Git over SSH instead.</p>
<p>For example, without a configured key GitLab shows</p>
<p><code>https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research.git</code></p>
<p>for our example repository, whereas with a configured key it would show</p>
<p><code>git@gitlab.com:somenovice/research.git</code>.</p>
<p>The HTTPS link still works if a SSH key is configured, it is only no longer shown by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We instruct Git to add a remote called <code>origin</code> with the last part as the address. Make sure to copy that last part from the project overview page, because it represents the Git address of your project’s repository on GitLab. It will be different for everyone.</p>
<p>Note also, that we skipped the second line of the instructions. It renames an existing remote <code>origin</code> to <code>old-origin</code>, but we have no existing remote.</p>
<div id="callout7" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="names-for-remotes" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Names for remotes</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Apart from following restrictions that Git puts on remote names, which can be avoided without much thought by using only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, we should choose meaningful names for remotes, in particular, when we add multiple remotes to a local repository.</p>
<p>In most examples, <code>origin</code> is used as the name for a remote, because it is the name of the remote created when cloning a repository. It is a meaningful name for the main remote repository, if there is one. This together with its ubiquitous use make it a very good name.</p>
<p>In other cases, we might call a remote to a private copy of the main repository after our username or server it is located on, for example <code>uni</code> for a university GitLab instance.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, we push our changes to the remote repository. The command will prompt for our user name and password:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push -u origin --all</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<pre><code>Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.

<p>{: .output}</p>
<p>Having successfully pushed our commit to the GitLab repository, we change to our browser and navigate to the project (or reload it, if we still have it open). We will be greeted by the project homepage, similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/first-push.png" alt="Project homepage of a project. On the left, a menu leading to other project pages. On the right, taking up most of the width, the project homepage. Starting from the top, we first have the project title, Research Diary, followed by a line of statistical values (1 Commit, 1 Branch, 0 Tags, 72KB files, 72 KB Storage). Under these we see the description: “My research diary, a collection of Markdown files”. In the next line we see a drop-down field for branches showing “main”, the project slug¸“test”, a drop-down button labeled “+”, and buttons labeled “History”, “Find file”, “Web IDE”, a download symbol, and ”Clone”. This is followed by a box giving information on the last commit of the current branch: the commit message “Add README.md”, the authors name and how far in the past the commit was authored, as well as prefix of the commit’s hash with a copy-to-clipboard button. This is followed by some buttons that allow to add or upload new files or setup some of GitLab features for the project. Next is a list of files, in this case only `README.md`, with information when it was last updated and through which commit. Finally, we see a rendering of `README.md`." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project homepage after first push</figcaption></figure><p>Let us look at what has changed compared to its initial state. The interface elements encouraging us to add members to the project are gone. Of course, we can still navigate to the project’s Members later on, if we need to. We also, correctly, no longer get told that the repository is empty and the instructions on how to push content to the repository have vanished.</p>
<p>Instead, we see some statistics below the project’s title: 1 Commit, 1 Branch, 0 Tags, 72 KB Files, 72 KB Storage. They double as buttons other project pages.</p>
<p>Below the description is a new button bar, followed by a box presenting information on last commit of the currently select branch.</p>
<p>The buttons below, that we saw earlier, allow us to add specific files or navigate to the configuration of certain GitLab features. Note that one button changed from reading “Add README” to just “README”, since we added <code>README.md</code>. The button is now a link to the latest version of that file in the current branch.</p>
<p>Then we see a list of files. So far, there is only <code>README.md</code>. The list also tells us through which commit it was last changed and when that commit was created.</p>
<p>Finally, we see the markdown file <code>README.md</code> rendered. Because having a README-file in the root directory of a repository is a widespread convention, GitLab (and other platforms like it) usually render it on a project’s homepage.</p>
</section><section id="deleting-a-project"><h2 class="section-heading">Deleting a Project</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We just went through the beginning of a GitLab project’s life cycle. At its end, if it has one, a project gets deleted. We will go through the process of deleting a process now, without doing the step.</p>
<p>Using the menu on the left, we navigate to the projects settings.</p>
<p>At the bottom the page, we find a section named “Advanced”. We hit the “Expand” button right next to it and scroll to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Notice that many of buttons here are not the usual blue or white, but first an orange-brown and then red. This indicates that we should be careful about clicking them. Things might break or, as we want to have a look at now, get deleted.</p>
<p>At the bottom we find a section labeled “Delete Project”.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/delete-project.png" alt="A box with red headline “Delete this project”, followed by the warning “This action deletes `somenovice/reseach-diary` and everything this project contains. **There is no going back**”, and a red button labeled “Delete project”." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Delete project section</figcaption></figure><p>Clicking the button will not directly delete the project, as the warning says, but requires you to type the project location and slug, <code>&lt;username&gt;/research-diary</code> in our case, into a text field and clicking another button. <strong>Do not delete the project now! We will work with it throughout this lesson.</strong></p>

<p>Git and GitLab can be and is used for one-person projects. But we want our colleagues to contribute to our research diary, when they keep tabs on our experiments for us on the weekends. To achieve this, we will grant others access to our GitLab project.</p>
<p>Using the menu on the left side of the project homepage (or nearly any other project page), we navigate to the project members page hovering over or clicking on “Project Information” and then clicking on “Members” in the submenu. The project member page should look similar to the following screenshot:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/initial-members.png" alt="Webpage coutout titled “Project Members” with three buttons next to the title: “Import from a project”, “Invite a group”, and “Invite members”. Below a table listing the project’s members, showing account holder‘s name with account name, the membership source, when access was granted, the member’s maximum role and the membership expiration date. The table contains one column: ”Philipp Matthias Schäfer, @fiveop, Direct member, 2 weeks ago by himself, Maintainer, and no Expiration date." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project members page</figcaption></figure><p>On the page we can see the page title, “Project members”, three buttons to the left of the title, and a filterable table of members, currently only listing ourselves.</p>
<p>The table shows our full name and account name, why we are a member of this project, when we got access—at the moment we created the project—what our maximum role is—more on that in a bit—and a disabled membership expiration date widget.</p>
<p>For practice we will all add an instructor to our project and remove them again right away. Click the button labeled “Invite members”, type in the username your instructors provided you with into the search field, make sure that “Guest” is selected as a role, and click the button labeled “Invite”.</p>
<p>After reloading the page, your instructor should now be listed next to you in the table. Unlike in your row, you can change the role and the expiration date of this new entry. There also is a new, red button in this row labeled “Remove member”.</p>
<p>The role determines what the member is allowed to do in the project. A maintainer has full rights, a guest almost none. GitLab’s handbook gives a detailed <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html" class="external-link">overview</a> of the different roles’ permissions.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to remove the instructor from your project’s members again. Click the button labeled “Remove member” in the instructor’s row then click the button of the same name in the popup dialog. The page reloads itself and the entry vanishes from the table.</p>

<p>Now, everyone should be the member of one of your co-learners’ projects. We will now add an diary entry for the work we did on their experiments last weekend.</p>
<p>First, we clone their repositories into the directory <code>rd-colleague</code>.</p>

<p>Now we are sure that everything is in order with the cloned repository and we can add our lab entry. Let us do that:</p>

<p>We have now recorded in pairs lab work we carried out for a colleague during the last weekend. Curious what our colleagues did for us, we navigate back to the directory of our own repository in the shell, for example:</p>
<pre><code>cd ../research-diary</code></pre>
<p>There, we pull the changes that our colleagues previously pushed.</p>

<p>In the first episode, we already got to know groups; GitLab’s way to organize projects. A group might hold a projects of a research group or those of a research project with contributors from multiple institutions.</p>
<p>In this episode we will create (and delete) a group, move our project, and learn how members of a group relate to its subgroups and projects.</p>
<section id="creating-a-group"><h2 class="section-heading">Creating a Group</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In the top menu bar, we open the drop-down menu labeled with a boxed plus and select the menu item “New Group”. On the next page, we select “Create group”, because that is what we want to do.</p>
<p>This leads to the following page:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/create-group.png" alt="Create group form" class="figure mx-auto d-block">{alt=“Create group form with text input fields labeled “Group name”, “Group URL”, a radio button element labeled “Visibility Level” with options “Private” and “Public”, a drop-down field labeled “Role”, a radio button element labeled “Who will be using this group?” with options “My company or team” and “Just me”, a drop-down field labeled “What will you use this group for?” and an text input field labeled “Email 1” with a button to add more under the heading “Invite members (optional)”."}</figure><p>Choose any name for the group, for example a fictional research group like “Ant-Sized Elephants’ Applications Lab”. When you move the focus out of the input field, for example by pressing the tabulator key, GitLab will suggest a URL for the group. Usually, we might want to adapt it, but for now all we care about that it is available.</p>
<p>You can leave the group’s visibility private. The visibility of a group works like that of a project.</p>
<p>We will leave the remaining fields as they are and create the group by clicking the blue button labeled “Create group”. GitLab will navigate to the group home page, listing the group’s subgroups and projects (currently none).</p>
<p>Now, we will have a look at how to create a project in the new group.</p>
<p>In the top menu bar, we open the drop-down menu labeled with a boxed plus and select the menu item “New Project”. On the next page, we select “Create blank project”.</p>
<p>This leads to the create blank project form page. We do not really want to create a project. Instead we have a look at the drop-down field under the heading “Project URL”. It will either show your username or one of the groups you belong to.</p>
<p>If the field does not show the URL of the group that we just created, clicking on the field should open a drop-down list which includes it and allows us to select it.</p>
<p>Submitting the form with our group’s URL selected would create a project in that group.</p>
</section><section id="move-project-to-group"><h2 class="section-heading">Move Project to Group</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We will now move our project to our group.</p>
<p>On the side menu, we select “Settings” then “General”. On that page, we expand the section labeled “Advanced” and scroll down to the subsection labeled “Transfer Project”.</p>
<p>Now, please read the subsections notes, with an emphasis on the list of things to be aware of.</p>
<p>A few comments on the last two items of the list:</p>
<p>The second to last tells us that we will need to update our local repositories to point to the new location. Because we are moving the project to a group from our own projects, the URL will change. So the URL we specified when adding the remote to our local repository will no longer be valid. We will test this, but will not change the URL, because we will move the project back in a bit.</p>
<p>The last item on the list informs us about potential visibility changes. For example, moving a public project to a private group, will cause the project to become private.</p>
<p>Having carefully read and thought about the warnings, we are ready to move our project. We select the group that we previously created from the drop-down field and click the button labeled “Transfer project”.</p>
<p>A dialog appears and we confirm, that we are sure, by typing in the name of our project and clicking the button labeled “Confirm”.</p>
<p>The project will be transferred to the group.</p>
<p>To test that the URL changed, we switch to the shell and navigate to the directory containing our repository; <strong>Not the repository of our co-learner</strong>!</p>
<p>Running</p>
<pre><code>git remote get-url origin</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<p>should tell us that our project points to the old project URL. So, let us try to run</p>
<pre><code>git pull</code></pre>
<p>{: .language-bash}</p>
<pre><code>Already up to date.</code></pre>
<p>{: .output}</p>
<p>That result is unexpected. The reason for this is that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes" class="external-link">GitLab will redirect the old URLs to the new ones, as long as the old URLs do not point to a new project.</a></p>

<p>After adding a member to the group, we have look at the member list of our research diary project.</p>
<p>The list has three entries: ourselves, our co-learner, and our instructor. We have the “Owner” role and, as its creator, are a direct member of the project. Our co-learner has the “Developer” role that we assigned them and are also a direct member of the project, as we added them directly to the project.</p>
<p>The entry we are really interested in is that of the instructor. We added them as a “Guest” to the group. Now, they show up in the list of this project with the same role. The reason is, as the column “Source” tells us, that our project is in our group, and our instructor is a member of that group.</p>
<p>That means, <strong>projects and groups inherit the members of the group they belong to</strong>.</p>

<p>Before our excursion to learn about groups, we contributed lab notes to our co-learner’s repository. Having done that, we think we should be listed as contributors in the documentation of that repository. Since, we want our co-learner to do the honors, we create an issue in their repository.</p>
<p>With our co-learner’s help, we navigate to their project. On the side bar menu on the left we click the entry labeled “Issues” and on the following page we click on the button labeled “New issue”.</p>
<p>This leads us to the following form:</p>

<p>Markdown provides syntax for formatting text in a monospaced font, this is usually used to typeset code, because code is usually written to be readable in such fonts.</p>

<p>The filename <code>README.md</code> will be set in a monospaced font.</p>
<p>For a whole block of monospaced text, for example some lines of code, start and end the block with a line consisting of three or more backquotes, where the number should match for start and end, for example</p>
<pre><code>```
