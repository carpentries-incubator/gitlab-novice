# Introduction to GitLab

[GitLab] is a web application for managing [Git] repositories.
Since it is build around Git, it is suitable to manage any project that works primarily with plain text files, for example software source code, TeX based documents, or meeting notes in Markdown.
With its built-in issue and wiki systems, it can, in certain cases, even be the right tool for managing a project without any files.

This lesson will give you a foundational understanding of GitLab’s features, so you can make informed decisions on how to use it as a tool.

Since GitLab interprets many of its text fields’ values as Markdown, more specifically [GitLab flavored Markdown][GitLabMarkdown], this lesson contains a rudimentary introduction to Markdown syntax, following the [CommonMark specification][CommonMark] on which the GitLab flavor is based.

Depending on previous knowledge of learners, the material can either be taught using solely the GitLab web interface or it can involve parts that teach the interaction with a local Git repository, using the Git command-line interface.
