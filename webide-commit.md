To save the changes, the creation of the file and the text we entered, we need to create a so called commit.
A commit packages changes in one or more files of the repository.
The list of commits, in chronological order, constitute the history of a Git repository.

To get there, we click on the button on the left showing an icon that indicates a branching from one circle to two others.
The button should be overlaid with the number 1 in a circle.

A dialog will replace the list of files.
At the top is a text field for a commit message.
Then comes a button labeled “Commit & Push”, followed by a list of all files that were changed, added, or deleted.
