<hr class="half-width">
<p>GitLab is a web application for managing software projects. However,
the features it provides can also be used for related purposes; for
example, issue or task management, document management or project
management in general.</p>
<p>GitLab is open source software and can be run by anyone on their own
hardware. The company behind the software runs one instance under <a href="https://gitlab.com" class="external-link uri">https://gitlab.com</a> where
anyone (resident in a country or territory not sanctioned by the USA)
can create an account and use it within certain limits for free. But
there are also instances run by diverse people and institutions from
hobbyists, over small NGOs, to large organizations (e.g.Â <a href="https://gitlab.dlr.de/" class="external-link uri">https://gitlab.dlr.de/</a>).
Those are not necessarily publicly accessible.</p>
<p>GitHub is a direct competitor to, and probably an inspiration for,
GitLab. Unlike GitLab, GitHub is not open source software, but large
customers can run their own instances. With respect to the content
covered by this lesson GitLab and GitHub are very similar and only
differ in details. So, if you are already familiar with using GitHub,
all this lesson can probably teach you is how concepts already familiar
to you from GitHub are called in GitLab.</p>

<p>This exercise should take about 1 minute.</p>

<p>When we log into GitLab for the first time, we are greeted by a
welcome page, offering us four ways to move forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>âCreate a projectâ</li>
<li>âCreate a groupâ</li>
<li>âExplore public projectsâ</li>
<li>âLearn more about GitLabâ</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover how to create a project and a group in the next
episode. For now, we want to learn how to navigate GitLab.</p>
<p>For that we select âExplore public projectsâ. This leads us to an
overview page of projects that are visible to us. The project is the
main organizational unit of GitLab.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The welcome page is only shown as long as you are not a member of any
project yet. On instances other than GitLab.com it might also not be
shown. In those cases the configured homepage is shown.</p>
<p>The project dashboard page is the default homepage. However, the
homepage is a configuration option for GitLab instances as well as
individual users; the latter overriding the former. You may have changed
that setting or an administrator might have changed the global
configuration of the instance.</p>
<p>You can always navigate to the project dashboard page by clicking on
the GitLab logo in the upper left corner.</p>

<p>On the âExplore projectsâ page, have a look at what projects you can
see in the first three tabs (âAllâ, âMost starredâ, and âTrendingâ).
Play around with the filters and sort settings.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minute.</p>

<p>The âExplore projectsâ page looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/project-explore.png" alt="Explore projects page with tab âMost starredâ open. The tab shows a list of projects with icon, name, descriptions, and four statistical values for each entry." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project overview page</figcaption></figure><p>The first tab, âAllâ, lists all projects that are visible to you in
most recently updated order.</p>
<p>The second tab, âMost starred projectsâ, also lists all projects, but
this time ordered most starred first. Users of a GitLab instance can
âstarâ a project, which is the equivalent of bookmarking them, as we
will see shortly.</p>
<p>The third tab, âTrendingâ, lists all projects again, but this time
ordered by activity during the previous months.</p>
<p>You can use the filter field next to the tab names to search through
all projects that are visible to you.</p>

<p>The second organizational entity, next to projects, are groups.
Groups can contain projects and other groups and can therefore be used
to structurally organize multiple projects. In a later episode, when we
talk about members of groups and projects, we learn about another use
for groups.</p>
<p>Groups and projects work somewhat similar to directories and files in
the file system. Every group and every project can be contained in only
one group and a group cannot contain itself.</p>
<p>To make our lives easier later on, we introduce two terms regarding a
groupâs position in this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group not contained in another group is called <strong>top-level
group</strong>.</li>
<li>A group contain in another group is called a
<strong>subgroup</strong> of that group.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>After knowing how to find groups and projects. We want to go from
passively browsing GitLab to actively using it. We are going to create a
project and connect a local Git repository to it.</p>
<p>To create a project, we click on the button with the â+â symbol near
the top of the side menu on the right and select âNew
project/repositoryâ.</p>
<p>Multiple options are presented for how to create the new project. In
this lesson we will only look at, and use, the first option: âCreate
blank projectâ. So click on that.</p>
<p>This leads to the following page:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/create-project.png" alt="Create blank project form with text input fields labeled âProject nameâ, âProject URLâ, âProject slugâ, âProject deployment target (optional)â, a radio button element labeled âVisibility Levelâ with options âPrivateâ and âPublicâ, and two checkboxes labeled âInitialize repository with a READMEâ and âEnable Static Application Security Testing (SAST)â." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Create blank project form</figcaption></figure><p>The âProject nameâ field is for just that, the project name. Its
value has no other purpose and can be changed at anytime without
indirect consequences (the direct consequence being, that its name will
be different). We will call it âResearch Diaryâ.</p>
<p>As we fill in the project name, a project slug gets suggested in the
respective field. The project slug is the last part of the projectâs,
and the associated Git repositoryâs, URL or web address.</p>
<p>If the user belongs to at least one group, the URLâs middle part can
be chosen in the drop-down field labeled âProject URLâ, which defaults
to the current userâs username. The default, indicated by the userâs
name, is the location for a userâs projects (and groups). Other options
in the drop-down list are the groups in which the current user may
create projects.</p>
<div id="project-url-and-project-slug" class="callout callout">

<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>

<h3 class="callout-title">Project URL and Project Slug<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-url-and-project-slug"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The two fields under labels âProject URLâ and âProject slugâ are the
only fields in this form for which changing the value later might cause
problems. They determine the URL under which the projectâs pages and the
projectâs Git repository can be found, so changing them later might
brake links and bookmarks as well as connections from Git repositories
on other systems, for example on contributorsâ machines.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We ignore the field labeled âProject deployment target
(optional)â.</p>
<p>The choice under label âVisibility Levelâ determines the projectâs
visibility.</p>
<div id="visiblity" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>

<h3 class="callout-title">Visiblity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#visiblity"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>GitLab offers three settings for the visibility of a project: public,
internal, and private. Publicly visible projects can be looked at by
anyone that can access the GitLab instance, projects with internal
visibility can be looked at by anyone logged in to the instance, while
projects with private visibility can only be looked at by its
members.</p>
<p>On GitLab.com the visibility âinternalâ is disabled. Everyone can
create an account, log in to the instance, and thus could look at any
project of internal visibility anyway.</p>
<p>Self-hosted instances might also disable some visibility types. For
example, the public visibility might be disabled, to prevent users from
publishing something to the whole internet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We choose âPrivateâ for our projectâs visibility.</p>
<p>If, as per default, the checkbox âInitialize repository with a
READMEâ is checked, the projectâs repository will be initialized with a
commit that adds a file called <code>README.md</code>. Otherwise, a the
project will start with an empty repository. We will add such a file
later ourselves, so we uncheck the box.</p>
<div id="readme" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="readme" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">README<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#readme"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A projectâs README file usually contains basic information about the
project: what it contains, how it can be used (for example built or
installed, if it is a software project), how to contribute, how to get
help, and licensing information.</p>
<p>It is common to write README files in Markdown format, indicated by
the filename suffix <code>.md</code>.</p>
<p>Platforms like GitLab show the contents of a projectâs README file on
its homepage; if it is in Markdown format, in its rendered form.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We will ignore any other fields that may be visible depending on the
GitLab instances configuration.</p>
<p>After clicking the âCreate projectâ button, GitLab creates the
project and redirects us to the projectâs homepage, which looks similar
to this:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/new-project.png" alt="Project homepage for a new project. On the left, a menu starting with three buttons for issues, merge requests, and to-do lists, as well as a search field. Those are followed by a list of links and  sub-menus: the project name, open sub-menu Pinned with items Issues and  Merge requests, sub-menus Manage, Plan, Code, Build, Secure, Deploy, Operate, Monitor, Analyze, Settings, and Help. On the right, taking up the major part of the page width, the project page: Starting at the top, the projectâs name âResearch Diaryâ, an encouragement to âInvite your teamâ with a button âInvite membersâ, the statement that âThe repository for this project is emptyâ with various buttons for getting initial content into the repository. At the bottom, the beginning of instructions on how to push an existing repository are visible, but cut off." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Fresh project homepage</figcaption></figure><p>The page is split into the menu on the left and the project overview
on the right.</p>
<p>The menu leads to pages related to various properties, processes, and
content of the project. It is visible on each of these pages. The number
of menu entries may seem overwhelming, in particular when one notices
that the entries have subentries. However, it is not necessary to know
what hides behind all these entries to use GitLab. Following this
lesson, we will get to know parts of what lies behind the entries
âManageâ, âPlanâ, âCodeâ, âBuildâ, and âSettingsâ.</p>
<p>The project overview shows (from the top): The projectâs avatar (or
icon) and name; a prompt to invite team members (we will cover members
later on); a statement that our repository is currently empty with
buttons for several options to add content to it; and finally the
beginning of the instructions on how to push a local repository to this
projectâs repository to fill it with content. We will follow them in
just a bit.</p>
<p>The project overview page will look slightly different, once we have
content in its repository. We will have another look at the page
then.</p>

<p>Click on the âSettingsâ sub-menu and select its âGeneralâ entry. Set
the description to âMy research diary, a collection of Markdown

<p>The project description appears in many lists and on some pages under
the projectâs name.</p>
<p>Then change any of the projectâs name, visibility, or avatar. Do not
forget to click the âSave changesâ button once you are done.</p>

<p>Markdown is a markup language like HTML, on which the World Wide Web
is based, or wikitext, which is used to write Wikipediaâs content. Its
markup directives, indicating for example that something is a headline
or a list item, are such that they serve their purpose even in the plain
text form.</p>
<p>There are many variants (or flavors) of Markdown and GitLab has <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html" class="external-link">its own</a>. Other
than for rendering Markdown files in repositories on its web interface,
GitLab allows for Markdown input in many of its interfaceâs text fields,
such as issue descriptions or comments.</p>
<p>This will be pointed out as we get to use these fields during the
lesson.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The project overview page presents us with many options to add
content to the projectâs repository directly in GitLab. We will add our
first file to the project repository in the next episode.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We just went through the beginning of a GitLab projectâs life cycle.
At its end, if it has one, a project gets archived (or deleted). We will
now go through the process of archiving a project, without completing
the procedure.</p>
<p>Using the menu on the left, we navigate to the projectâs âGeneralâ
settings.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, we find a section named âAdvancedâ. We
click on the âExpandâ button right next to it and scroll down the
page.</p>
<p>Notice that some of buttons here are not the usual blue or white, but
rather red. This indicates that we should be careful about clicking
them. Things might break or get deleted.</p>
<p>Scrolling back up, we find a section labeled âArchive Projectâ.
Clicking the button will not delete the project. Instead it will be
placed in a read-only mode. Everything will be preserved but nothing can
be changed anymore. In addition, the project no longer shows up in
search results and on the page for exploring projects.</p>
<p>Most of the time archiving a project is preferable to deleting it, in
particular when it comes to research projects. <strong>Do not archive
the project now! We will work with it throughout this
lesson.</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of the page is also a section for deleting a project,
in case you ever think that is the right thing to do.</p>

git push -u origin --tags</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We already covered the global setup.</p>
<p>The next three sets of instructions are mutually exclusive. The first
is not for us, because we already created a repository. Neither is the
second, because although we have a directory with contents, its already
a Git repository. That leaves us with the third option, which is the one
applicable to our situation: âPush an existing Git repository.â</p>
<p>Transferring our changes to a remote repository is called
<strong>push</strong>ing, because we are sending the changes from us,
the local repository, to somewhere else, a remote repository. Later on
we will â<strong>pull</strong>â changes from a remote repository,
completing the analogy.</p>
<p>Going back to the shell, we configure our projectâs repository as a
remote in our local repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research-diary.git</code></pre>
<div id="https-vs-git" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">

<h3 class="callout-title">
<a href="https://" class="external-link uri">https://</a> vs
git@<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#https-vs-git"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>We assume throughout this lesson that the user has no SSH key is
configured, because we do not want to make the setup of such a key a
prerequisite.</p>
<p>If however, a user has configured an SSH key for their account,
GitLab would default to showing links to repositories in the form for
Git over SSH instead.</p>
<p>For example, without a configured key GitLab shows</p>
<p><code>https://gitlab.com/somenovice/research.git</code></p>
<p>for our example repository, whereas with a configured key it would
show</p>
<p><code>git@gitlab.com:somenovice/research.git</code>.</p>
<p>The HTTPS link still works if a SSH key is configured, it is only no
longer shown by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We instruct Git to add a remote called <code>origin</code> with the
last part as the address. Make sure to copy that last part from the
project overview page, because it represents the Git address of your
projectâs repository on GitLab. It will be different for everyone.</p>
<p>Note also, that we skipped the second line of the instructions. It
renames an existing remote <code>origin</code> to
<code>old-origin</code>, but we have no existing remote.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Apart from following restrictions that Git puts on remote names,
which can be avoided without much thought by using only letters,
numbers, underscores, and hyphens, we should choose meaningful names for
remotes, in particular, when we add multiple remotes to a local
repository.</p>
<p>In most examples, <code>origin</code> is used as the name for a
remote, because it is the name of the remote created when cloning a
repository. It is a meaningful name for the main remote repository, if
there is one. This together with its ubiquitous use make it a very good
name.</p>
<p>In other cases, we might call a remote to a private copy of the main
repository after our username or server it is located on, for example
<code>uni</code> for a university GitLab instance.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, we push our changes to the remote repository. The command
will prompt for our user name and password:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push -u origin --all</code></pre>

<p>Having successfully pushed our commit to the GitLab repository, we

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We are now going to add a file to our project. To do this, we first
navigate to the projectâs homepage, unless we are already on that page.
Below the heading âThe repository for this project is emptyâ there are
several buttons. We click the one labeled âNew fileâ, which brings us to
a new page, the so called WebIDE.</p>
<p>The WebIDE shows a list of files on the left and a tabbed environment
for open files on the right. Wen we first open it, it shows a Welcome
page, which we can safely close by clicking the âxâ labeled button on
the Welcome pageâs tab at the top.</p>

<p>GitLabâs WebIDE uses a dark theme by default. To change it, click on
the gear icon in the lower left corner and select âThemesâ, then âColor

theme for the IDE. Light themes are listed at the top and dark themes at
the bottom. âGitLab Lightâ is GitLabâs own light theme. Select a theme
by clicking on its name.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To actually create a new file, we click on the button labeled with an
icon representing a sheet of paper with a plus sign in the lower right
corner. Note thate this button is only visible, if you mouse hovers over
the list of files, which is currently empty, on the left. An text input
field appears below the button, which prompts us for a filename. We type
<code>README.md</code> into the field and confirm by pressing the return
key.</p>
<p>The list of files should only have one entry: <code>README.md</code>.
The text editor itself shows the contents of the file
<code>README.md</code>: nothing so far. We see the filename at the top
in a tab, which indicates that we can open multiple files and switch
between them using the tabs at the top.</p>

<p>To save the changes, the creation of the file and the text we

in one or more files of the repository. The list of commits, in
chronological order, constitute the history of a Git repository.</p>
<p>To get there, we click on the button on the left showing an icon that
indicates a branching from one circle to two others. The button should
be overlaid with the number 1 in a circle.</p>
<p>A dialog will replace the list of files. At the top is a text field
for a commit message. Then comes a button labeled âCommit &amp; Pushâ,
followed by a list of all files that were changed, added, or
deleted.</p>
<p>A commit message should summarize the changes that are packaged into
the commit. <a href="https://cbea.ms/git-commit/" class="external-link">Good commit
messages</a> are what makes the history of a repository useful.</p>
<p>We enter a good commit message, for example âAdd README.mdâ and click
the button labeled âCommit to âmainââ.</p>
<p>Having done that, we are done editing and navigate back to the
projectâs homepage. To get there, we need to click on the button labeled
âGitLabâ in the lower left of the screen and select âGo to
<project name> project on GitLabâ from the list that pops up at the top.
This will open the project in a new window or tab, depending on the
settings of your browser.</project></p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We are greeted by the project homepage, similar to the following
screenshot:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/first-push.png" alt="Project homepage of a project. On the left, a menu leading to other project pages. On the right, taking up most of the width, the project homepage. Starting from the top, we first have the project title, Research Diary, followed by a line of statistical values (1 Commit, 1 Branch, 0 Tags, 209B Project Storage). Under these we see the description: âMy research diary, a collection of Markdown filesâ. This is followed by a box giving information on the last commit of the current branch: the commit message âAdd README.mdâ, the authors name and how far in the past the commit was authored, as well as prefix of the commitâs hash with a copy-to-clipboard button. In the next line we see a drop-down field for branches showing âmainâ, the project slugÂ¸âtestâ, a drop-down button labeled â+â, and buttons labeled âHistoryâ, âFind fileâ, âWeb IDEâ, a download symbol, and âCloneâ. This is followed by some buttons that allow to add or upload new files or setup some of GitLab features for the project. Next is a list of files, in this case only `README.md`, with information when it was last updated and through which commit. Finally, we see a rendering of `README.md`." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project homepage after first push</figcaption></figure><p>Let us look at what has changed compared to its initial state. The
interface elements encouraging us to add members to the project are
gone. Of course, we can still navigate to the projectâs Members page
later on, if we need to. We also, correctly, no longer get told that the
repository is empty and the instructions on how to push content to the
repository have vanished.</p>
<p>Instead, we see some statistics below the projectâs title: 1 Commit,
1 Branch, 0 Tags, 209B Project Storage. They double as buttons to other
project pages.</p>
<p>Below the description is a box presenting information on the last
commit of the currently selected branch, followed by a new button
bar.</p>
<p>The following buttons, that we saw earlier, allow us to add specific
files or navigate to the configuration of certain GitLab features. Note
that one button changed from reading âAdd READMEâ to just âREADMEâ,
since we added a file called <code>README.md</code>. The button is now a
link to the latest version of that file in the current branch.</p>
<p>Then we see a list of files. So far, there is only
<code>README.md</code>. The list also tells us through which commit it
was last changed and when that commit was created.</p>
<p>Finally, we see the rendered version of the markdown file
<code>README.md</code>. Because having a README-file in the root
directory of a repository is a widespread convention, GitLab (and other
platforms like it) usually render it on a projectâs homepage.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>So far, each of you has created a GitLab project that no one but you
can contribute to; depending on the visibility setting, no one but you
might be able to even see it.</p>
<p>Git and GitLab can be and is used for one-person projects. But we
want our colleagues to contribute to our research diary, when they keep
tabs on our experiments for us on the weekends. To achieve this, we will
grant others access to our GitLab project.</p>
<p>Using the menu on the left side of the project homepage (or nearly
any other project page), we navigate to the project members page
hovering over or clicking on âManageâ and then clicking on âMembersâ in
the submenu. The project member page should look similar to the
following screenshot:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/initial-members.png" alt="Webpage coutout titled âProject Membersâ with three buttons next to the title: âImport from a projectâ, âInvite a groupâ, and âInvite membersâ. Below a table listing the projectâs members, showing account holderâs name with account name, the membership source, the memberâs maximum role, the membership expiration date, and three activity timestamps: User created, Access granted, and Last activity. The table contains one column: âPhilipp Matthias SchÃ¤fer, @fiveop, Direct member Philipp Matthias SchÃ¤fer, Owner, no expiration date, and three dates for the activity timestamps." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Project members page</figcaption></figure><p>On the page we can see the page title, âProject membersâ, three
buttons to the left of the title, and a filterable table of members,
currently only listing ourselves.</p>
<p>The table shows our full name and account name, why we are a member
of this project, what our maximum role isâmore on that in a bitâ, when
we got accessâat the moment we created the projectâ, a disabled
membership expiration date widget, and three dates on our activity.</p>
<p>For practice we will all add an instructor to our project and remove
them again right away. Click the button labeled âInvite membersâ, type
in the username your instructors provided you with into the search
field, make sure that âGuestâ is selected as a role, and click the
button labeled âInviteâ.</p>
<p>Your instructor should now be listed next to you in the table. Unlike
in your row, you can change the role and the expiration date of this new
entry.</p>
<p>The role determines what the member is allowed to do in the project.
An owner has full rights, a guest almost none. GitLabâs handbook gives a
detailed <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html" class="external-link">overview</a> of
the different rolesâ permissions.</p>
<p>Now, we are going to remove the instructor from your projectâs
members again. Click the three dots on the right in the instructorâs
row, then click on âRemove memberâ, and finally click the button of the
same name in the popup dialog. The page reloads itself and the entry
vanishes from the table.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now that we are members of the project of one of our co-learners, we
can contribute to each others projects. We will add a diary entry for
imaginary work that we did on their experiments last weekend.</p>
<p>To navigate to our co-learnerâs project, we click on the GitLab-Logo
in the upper left corner of the page. The list under âYour projectsâ
should now contain at least two projects: the one we created ourselves
in the beginning and the project of our co-learner. We click on the name
of our co-learnerâs project to navigate to itâs homepage.</p>
<p>To add a file, we click on the button labeled âEditâ towards the
right of page above the list of files, and select WebIDE from the
popup-menu. This redirects us to a page with a file browser in a column
on the left, with most of the screen taken up by a box welcoming us to
the WebIDE.</p>
<p>We want to create a new file, as we created the
<code>README.md</code> file before. To do that we click on the button
above the list of files on the left that is marked with an icon
representing a sheet of paper with a +-sign on top of it. The button is
only visible, when the mouse hovers over the list of files.</p>
<p>A pop-up text input field prompts us for a name, which we will
provide: <code>2023-02-05.md</code>, the date on which we did the work
in the laboratory. We confirm the file name by pressing the return
key.</p>
<p>We see the result of our action in two ways: A file named
<code>2023-02-05.md</code> appeared in the list of files on the left and
a tab labeled <code>2023-02-05.md</code> showing an text editor appeared
in the space to the right of the list of files.</p>
<p>We will now add a list of things we supposedly did in the laboratory
last Sunday, for example:</p>

<p>Lists can be represented in Markdown by starting their items with a
<code>*</code> character followed by a space. If an list item wraps over
multiple lines, lines following the first are started with sufficient
spaces to align the lines text with the first lineâs text.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>* First item
* Second item with enough text to make us wrap to a second
  line.</code></pre>
</div>

</div>
<p>To save the changes, the creation of the file and the text we
entered, we need to create a so called commit. A commit packages changes
in one or more files of the repository. The list of commits, in
chronological order, constitute the history of a Git repository.</p>
<p>To get there, we click on the button on the left showing an icon that
indicates a branching from one circle to two others. The button should
be overlaid with the number 1 in a circle.</p>
<p>A dialog will replace the list of files. At the top is a text field
for a commit message. Then comes a button labeled âCommit &amp; Pushâ,
followed by a list of all files that were changed, added, or
deleted.</p>
<p>A commit message should summarize the changes that are packaged into
the commit. [Good commit messages][CommitMessages] are what makes the
history of a repository useful.</p>
<p>We enter a good commit message, for example âRecord work on
experiment A-13â and click the button labeled âCommit to âmainââ.</p>
<p>In the dialog that pops up in the center top of the screen, we select
âContinueâ.</p>
<p>Having done that, we are done editing and navigate back to
<strong>our</strong> projectâs homepage. To get there, we lick on the
button labeled âGitLabâ in the lower left of the screen and select âGo
to GitLabâ from the list that pops up at the top. This will open the
project view in a new window or tab, depending on the settings of your
browser. We select our own project from the list of projects under âYour
projectsâ.</p>
<p>In the list of files, we should see the file added by our
co-learner.</p>

<p>In the first episode, we already learned about groups; GitLabâs way
to organize projects. A group might hold projects of a research group or
those of a research project with contributors from multiple
institutions. Together with members and their permissions groups can be
used to manage access to multiple repositories (for example, restrict
access to certain repositories to staff while others may be accessed by
student assistants as well).</p>
<p>In this episode we will create (and delete) a group, move our
project, and learn how members of a group relate to its subgroups and
projects.</p>
<section id="creating-a-group"><h2 class="section-heading">Creating a Group<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-group"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To create a group, we click on the button with the â+â symbol near
the top of the side menu on the right and select âNew groupâ. On the
next page, we select âCreate groupâ.</p>
<p>This leads to the following page:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/create-group.png" alt="Create group form with text input fields labeled âGroup nameâ, âGroup URLâ, a radio button element labeled âVisibility Levelâ with options âPrivateâ and âPublicâ, a drop-down field labeled âRoleâ, a radio button element labeled âWho will be using this group?â with options âMy company or teamâ and âJust meâ, a drop-down field labeled âWhat will you use this group for?â and an text input field labeled âEmail 1â with a button to add more under the heading âInvite members (optional)â, and finally two buttons labeled âCreate groupâ and âCancelâ." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Create group form</figcaption></figure><p>Choose any name for the group, for example a fictional research group
like âAnt-Sized Elephantsâ Applications Labâ. When you move the focus
out of the input field, for example by pressing the tabulator key,
GitLab will suggest a URL for the group. Usually, we might want to adapt
it, but for now all we care about that it is available.</p>
<p>You can leave the groupâs visibility private. The visibility of a
group works like that of a project.</p>
<p>We will leave the remaining fields as they are and create the group
by clicking the blue button labeled âCreate groupâ. GitLab will navigate
to the group home page, which usually lists the groupâs subgroups and
projects. Since there are currently none, it shows two big buttons for
creating a new subgroup and a new project.</p>
<p>We will have a look at how to create a project in the new group.</p>
<p>We click on the button labeled âCreate new projectâ. On the next
page, we select âCreate blank projectâ.</p>
<p>This leads to the create blank project form page. We do not really
want to create a project. Instead we have a look at the drop-down field
under the heading âProject URLâ. Because of the way that we took to get
to this page, it is prefilled with our groupâs URL slug.</p>
<p>Submitting the form with our groupâs URL selected would create a
project in that group. But we will not do that.</p>
</section><section id="move-project-to-group"><h2 class="section-heading">Move Project to Group<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#move-project-to-group"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Instead, we will now move our project to our group.</p>
<p>We start, by navigating to our projectâs homepage. Once there, we
select âSettingsâ then âGeneralâ in the side menu. On that page, we
expand the section labeled âAdvancedâ and scroll down to the subsection
labeled âTransfer Projectâ.</p>
<p>Now, please read the subsections notes, with an emphasis on the list
of things to be aware of.</p>
<p>A few comments on the last two items of the list:</p>
<p>The second to last tells us that we will need to update our local
repositories to point to the new location. Because we are moving the
project to a group from our own projects, the URL will change. So the
URL we specified when adding the remote to our local repository will no
longer be valid. We will test this, but will not change the URL, because
we will move the project back in a bit.</p>
<p>The last item on the list informs us about potential visibility
changes. For example, moving a public project to a private group, will
cause the project to become private.</p>
<p>Having carefully read and thought about the warnings, we are ready to
move our project. We select the group that we previously created from
the drop-down field and click the button labeled âTransfer projectâ.</p>
<p>A dialog appears and we confirm, that we are sure, by typing in the
name of our project and clicking the button labeled âConfirmâ.</p>
<p>The project will be transferred to the group.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="check-that-the-project-url-changed-only-when-teaching-with-git">Check that the project URL changed (only when teaching with
Git)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#check-that-the-project-url-changed-only-when-teaching-with-git"></a>
</h3>
<p>To test that the URL changed, we switch to the shell and navigate to
the directory containing our repository; <strong>Not the repository of
our co-learner</strong>!</p>
<p>Running</p>
<pre><code>git remote get-url origin</code></pre>
<p>should tell us that our project points to the old project URL. So,
let us try to run</p>
<pre><code>git pull</code></pre>
<pre><code>Already up to date.</code></pre>
<p>That result is unexpected. The reason for this is that <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/#what-happens-when-a-repository-path-changes" class="external-link">GitLab
will redirect the old URLs to the new ones, as long as the old URLs do
not point to a new project.</a></p>

<p>After adding a member to the group, we a have look at the member list
of our research diary project.</p>
<p>The list has three entries: ourselves, our co-learner, and our
instructor. We have the âOwnerâ role and, as its creator, are a direct
member of the project. Our co-learner has the âMaintainerâ role that we
assigned them and are also a direct member of the project, as we added
them directly to the project.</p>
<p>The entry we are really interested in is that of the instructor. We
added them as a âGuestâ to the group. Now, they show up in the list of
this project with the same role. The reason is, as the column âSourceâ
tells us, that our project is in our group, and our instructor is a
member of that group.</p>
<p>That means, <strong>projects and groups inherit the members of the
group they belong to</strong>.</p>

<p>Before our excursion to learn about groups, we contributed lab notes
to our co-learnerâs repository. Having done that, we think we should be
listed as contributors in the documentation of that repository. Since,
we want our co-learner to do the honors, we create an issue in their
repository, to document our desire.</p>
<p>Issues are a feature of GitLab that allows us to organize tasks by
project and by group (and its descendant groups and projects). By
default anyone that has read access to a project can file issues. This
usually makes sense, because users can report their problems and ask
their questions that way, even when they are not supposed change
anything themselves.</p>
<p>With our co-learnerâs help, we navigate to their project. On the side
bar menu on the left we click the entry labeled âIssuesâ and on the
following page we click on the button labeled âNew issueâ.</p>

<p>We assign the new issue to our co-learner by selecting their account
in the drop-down field labeled âAssigneeâ. They need to be a member of
the project, directory or indirectly, in order to be listed in that
field.</p>
<p>Then we click the button labeled âCreate issueâ. This redirects us to
the new issueâs page. Near top we see its title followed by its
description. A text field below the description can be used to create a
comment and a side bar on right lists more fields that could be used to
further specify properties of that issue.</p>
</section><section id="add-a-label"><h2 class="section-heading">Add a Label<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#add-a-label"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We will assign a value to one of the fields, the one labeled
âLabelsâ, now.</p>
<p>We want to know when our co-learner starts to work on the issue. To
communicate that fact through GitLabâs issue system we can use its Label
feature. Issues can be defined for groups and projects. In the case of
groups they are then also available to all its descendant groups and
projects.</p>
<p>So, if we want to assign a label to the issue, we first have to
create it. We click on the âEditâ link next to the âLabelâ field in the
side bar. This opens a small dialog titled âAssign labelsâ. If we had
already defined labels, they would be listed here.</p>
<p>Since have not, we click the link âCreate project labelâ in the small
dialog. A new dialog opens titled âCreate project labelâ. We call it
âWIPâ for work in progress and select our preferred color. Colors are
often used to group labels, for example one color for labels referring
to the subproject or subsystem the issue relates to, another color for
the current progress of the issue (like our WIP label), etc. Then we
click the button labeled âCreateâ.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the âAssign labelsâ dialog, this time with our
new label listed. We select our label by clicking it and close the
dialog by clicking on the x in the upper right corner.</p>
</section><section id="comment-on-an-issue"><h2 class="section-heading">Comment on an Issue<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#comment-on-an-issue"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We provided a generic description of the issue in its description,
but we want to make sure that our co-learner does not forget to include
us. So we write a comment regarding our inclusion.</p>
<p>To support our case we want to reference our contribution. For this,
we can use another feature of GitLabâs markdown: When we mention a
commit of the projectâs repository by its identifier, GitLab will
automatically convert it to a link to the page of the commit.</p>
<p>First we need to know the identifier of our commit. We navigate to
the projectâs commit history by clicking the submenu item âCommitsâ of
the menu item âCodeâ in the side menu. There we find our commit at the
top with a short sequence of numbers and letters on the right. This is
beginning, the prefix, of the commitâs identifier, which is also called
a SHA due to how it is created. Right next to the prefix is a button
with an icon that looks like a clipboard. As its tooltip tells us,
clicking it will copy the commit SHA (identifier). We click on the
button.</p>
<p>We navigate back to our issue by clicking the menu item âIssuesâ in
the side menu and clicking on the title of our issue in the list that
opened.</p>
<p>Using the copied commit identifier, we formulate our commit similar
to</p>
<pre><code>Please mention me as a contributor due to commit 4eac24cafbcebc4f0d528bd2e1246a4624265085.</code></pre>
<p>and click the button labeled âCommentâ. A new box shows up above the
comment text area showing our message. We can see that GitLab uses and
shortened version of the commits identifier for the link text, which
makes it slightly more readable.</p>
<p>Before we move on, please note the button labeled âClose issueâ under
the comment text field. An issue starts in the open state and can be
closed by clicking this button. When we type something into the comment
field the label of the button changes to âComment &amp; close issueâ, so
we can add a final comment before closing the issue.</p>
<p>This is a very important feature, allowing us to distinguish between
issues that have yet to be dealt with and those that have already been
dealt with. We do not, in general, delete issues, because they are often
still useful even if closed already. For example, we can use the search
to check whether a certain topic was already discussed in the past.</p>
</section><section id="issue-boards"><h2 class="section-heading">Issue Boards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#issue-boards"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now, we will have a look at boards, a feature that uses labels to
visually organize a projectâs issues.</p>
<p>We navigate to our projectâs issue board by clicking the submenu item
âIssue boardsâ of the menu item âPlanâ in the side menu.</p>
<p>The following page loads:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/board.png" alt="Issue board page with a menu bar on the left and content on the right. At the top of the content area is a drop-down field with âDevelopmentâ selected followed by a search field, a check box labeled âShow labelsâ, and two buttons the first labeled âEdit boardâ, the second âCreate listâ. Below these elements are two columns, each with a title bar, one titled âOpenâ, the other âClosedâ. In the âOpenâ column there is a box representing an issue, showing its title âRecognize outside contributorsâ, a label âWIPâ, the issue number â#1â and an avatar of a user." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>Issue board page</figcaption></figure><p>By default, GitLab creates one board, called âDevelopmentâ, for each
project. This is the board we see. It has two so called lists
configured, labeled âOpenâ and âClosedâ, which list all open and closed
issues of the project, respectively. These two lists cannot be
deleted.</p>
<p>We will now create another list for issues that are work in progress,
that is those that are labeled âWIPâ.</p>
<p>We click on the button labeled âCreate Listâ. A new list appears to
the right of the âClosedâ list. We are prompted to select a label. We
select our label âWIPâ and click the button labeled âAdd to boardâ.</p>
<p>The new list is created between the âOpenâ and âClosedâ lists. Those
two will always be on the left and right end, respectively. We can
reorder the lists created by us however we want between these two.</p>
<p>Note, that our issue is initially shown in the âOpenâ list and our
new list. When we reload the page, it disappears from the âOpenâ list.
In general, open issues that belong to one of the custom lists, due to
their labels, will not appear in the âOpenâ list. Closed issues,
however, will always only appear in the âClosedâ list.</p>
<p>Boards can not only be used to get an overview of a projectâs issues.
They can also be used to manipulate their labels. If we drag an issue
from one list to another, the label of the originating list will be
removed and that of the target list will be added (unless it is one of
the âOpenâ and âClosedâ lists). Moving an issue to the âClosedâ list
will close the issue, while moving an issue out of the âClosedâ list
will reopen it.</p>
<p>We note that we added the âWIPâ label to our issue, however, that is
not accurate. Our co-learner should add the label whenever they start to
work on it. To remove the label we drag the issue to the âOpenâ
list.</p>
<p>We click on the issueâs title to navigate to its page. Initially the
comment text field was directly under the description. By now, there is
a list that chronicles the changes to the issue. It starts with the
assignment to our co-learner (from creating the issue), next we see that
the âWIPâ label was added by us, then comes our comment, and finally it
lists that we removed the âWIPâ label again.</p>
<p>This helps keep track of who did what at which point in time.</p>

<p>In the episode on collaboration, we learned how to contribute changes
to a project that we are a member of. We also learned, in the previous
episode, that we can contribute to other projects by filing issues to
report problems or ask questions. In this episode, we will learn about a
way to suggest concrete changes to a GitLab project to which we have no
write access.</p>
<p>The feature that allows us to do this is called Merge Request, the
corresponding feature on GitHub is called Pull Request. As a target for
our merge request, we will use our co-learners repository. We do have
write access to it, but sometimes even then we want to suggest changes
instead of just making them.</p>
<p>We will create a merge request for a file that lists the
contributors. This will solve the issue that we filed during the
previous episode.</p>
<section id="create-a-fork"><h2 class="section-heading">Create a Fork<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-fork"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Since we are a member of our co-learnerâs project we could create a
merge request within the project. But this is no longer true if we ever
want to suggest changes to a project that we are not a member of. So, to
learn a little more, we will make ourselves some extra work.</p>
<p>So, suppose that we cannot make changes to our co-learnerâs project.
We need a copy that we can change. Such a copy is called a fork in
GitLabâs (and also GitHubâs) case. The term can be explained by looking
at its use in âfork in the roadâ: Once we make changes to our copy, the
development history will have forked into two different directions.</p>
<p>To create a fork, we navigate to the homepage of our co-learnerâs
project. In the upper right corner is a button labeled âForksâ. The
number next to it tells us how many forks of this repository exist on
GitLab. We will now increase that number by one by clicking on the
button.</p>
<p>This redirects us to a form that looks like a reduced version of the
âCreate new projectâ form, which correctly indicates that by forking, we
create a new project.</p>
<p>We need to select a namespace (group or our personal space) in which
the fork should be created. We click on the drop-down list under
âProject URLâ and select our username.</p>
<div id="unique-project-name" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="unique-project-name" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Unique Project Name<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unique-project-name"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>If there already is a project with the name or the same slug, GitLab
will show you an error message when you try to create the for. At the
time of me writing this, the message can be summarized to âan error has
occurredâ, which is not very helpful. If that happens, reload the page,
select a different name and/or slug and try again.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now we click the âFork projectâ button.</p>
<p>We are redirected to the forkâs project home page. The fork is a full
featured project just like the original, however, only the Git
repository is copied. So, for example, there are no issues in it, even
though the original had at least one.</p>
</section><section id="create-and-edit-a-file-on-gitlab"><h2 class="section-heading">Create and Edit a File on GitLab<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-and-edit-a-file-on-gitlab"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Our goal is to create a file that lists contributors of the project.
We will do this within GitLab using its file creation and editing
features.</p>
<p>To add a file, we click on the button labeled âEditâ towards the
right of page above the list of files, and select WebIDE from the
popup-menu. This redirects us to a page with a file browser in a column
on the left, with most of the screen taken up by a box welcoming us to
the WebIDE.</p>
<p>We do not want to edit an existing file, but want to create a new
one. To do that we click on the button above the list of files on the
left that is marked with an icon representing a sheet of paper with a
+-sign on top of it. The button is only visible, when the mouse hovers
over the list of files.</p>
<p>A pop-up dialog prompts us for a name, which we will provide:
<code>CONTRIBUTORS.md</code>. Then we confirm the file name by pressing
the return key.</p>
<div id="all-caps-filenames" class="callout callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="all-caps-filenames" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">All caps filenames<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#all-caps-filenames"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In software projects it is customary to name certain files with
information about the project in all caps. One example we already
encountered is the README file. Others are the file containing the
license (<code>LICENSE</code>), a file about how to contribute
(<code>CONTRIBUTING</code>), or how to install the software
(<code>INSTALL</code>).</p>
<p>Sometimes a file extension indicating the format is appended, usually
in lower-case letters.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We see the result of our action in two ways: A file named
âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ appeared in the list of files on the left and a tab
labeled âCONTRIBUTORS.mdâ showing an text editor appeared in the space
to the right of the list of files.</p>
<p>We will now add something similar the following lines in the
editor:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">MARKDOWN<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

</div>
<p><code>{r, child=c('webide-commit.md')}</code></p>
<p>We enter an appropriate commit message, for example</p>
<pre><code>Add CONTRIBUTORS.md</code></pre>
<p>and click the button labeled âCommit to âmainââ.</p>
<p>In the dialog that pops up in the center top of the screen, we select
âContinueâ.</p>
</section><section id="create-a-merge-request"><h2 class="section-heading">Create a Merge Request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#create-a-merge-request"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Having created the commit, we navigate back to the project home page.
We lick on the button labeled âGitLabâ in the lower left of the screen
and select âGo &lt;project name&gt; project on GitLabâ from the list
that pops up at the top.</p>
<p>We notice that the file that we created is now present in the list of
files.</p>
<p>To create a merge request, we click on the menu item labeled âMerge
requestsâ in the menu on the left and on the following page on the
button labeled âNew merge requestâ.</p>
<p>This gets us to the following dialog:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/merge-request.png" alt="New merge request page. Below the page title, âNew merge requestâ, there are two UI elements side-by-side. The one on the left, titled âSource branchâ, has two drop-down fields, one to select the project, the other to select the branch. The former reads âfiveop-test/research-diary-2â, the latter âSelect source branchâ. Below the two drop-down files is a box stating âSelect a branch to compareâ The UI element on the right, titled âTarget branchâ, has the same two drop-down fields. In this case the former reads âfiveop/research-diaryâ and the latter âmainâ. Below the two drop-down fields is a box with information about the last commit on the âmainâ branch: message, author, date and identifier prefix. At the bottom of the page is a button labeled âCompare branches and continueâ. " class="figure mx-auto d-block"><figcaption>New merge request page</figcaption></figure><p>On the left side, we select the main branch for our change. Once
done, a box with details of the last commit on that branch appears below
the drop-down fields on the left.</p>
<p>We click the button labeled âCompare branches and continueâ. On the
following page, we can see that a merge request has its own title and
description. They are prefilled with the newest commit message of the
source branch. To connect this merge request with the issue that we
filed, we write</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="va">Resolves</span> <span class="co">#1</span></span></code></pre>
<p>in the merge request description. Everything else, we leave with its
default value or in its default state.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Whenever a merge request is merged to the default branch of a project
and its description or the description of one of its commits contains
the phrase <code>&lt;keyword&gt; #&lt;number&gt;</code> for one of the
<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#default-closing-pattern" class="external-link">keywords
mentioned in GitLabâs documentation</a>, then the issue with number
<code>&lt;number&gt;</code> is closed automatically.</p>
<p>This can save a few clicks and ensures that closing the issue will
not be forgotten.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We click the button labeled âCreate merge requestâ. This leads us to
the page for the created merge request. It looks similar to the page for
an issue.The main difference are the tabs, their headers being located
just below the title: âOverviewâ (the one that is shown initially),
âCommitsâ, âPipelinesâ, and âChangesâ.</p>
<p>Clicking on the tab header labeled âCommitsâ, we see a list of all
the commits of this merge request, which in our case is the commit we
created.</p>
<p>We ignore the tab labeled âPipelinesâ.</p>
<p>Clicking on the tab header labeled âChangesâ, we see a so called diff
for each of the changed files. In our case a file was added, so all the
lines in the file are new, indicated by the plus sign at the beginning
of each line and the background color green.</p>
<p>Back on the âOverviewâ tab, below the description there is button to
âApproveâ the merge request. By default this is optional, but a project
can be configured to require approval of merge requests by a certain
group of members. Then there is a grayed-out button labeled âMergeâ,
followed by text that we need to ask someone with write access to click
it. We will do exactly that in a moment. Note also, that the box around
it mentions that the merge request mentions the issue. This can
otherwise be easily overlooked, if the mention happens in a commit
message of the merge request.</p>
<p>Finally at the bottom, we see that a merge request can be commented
on, just like an issue.</p>
<p>But for merge request there is more. Navigating to the âChangesâ tab
and hovering the mouse over a line number, we see a speech bubble button
appear at the start of the line. When we press it, a text field for a
comment appears. We can use that to comment on individual lines. This
feature allows users to have separate discussions for different changes
of a merge request.</p>
<div id="code-review" class="callout callout">

<div id="code-review" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Code Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#code-review"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Being able to comment on individual lines is a useful feature for a
practice called code review. Code review entails that a peer of the
author of some changes reviews those, before they are merged. This
practice is the origin of the merge request feature, but it lends itself
as well to reviewing text based changes other than code.</p>

</div>
</section><section id="accept-a-merge-request"><h2 class="section-heading">Accept a Merge Request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#accept-a-merge-request"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>While we were creating the merge request for our co-learnerâs
repository, they did the same for ours. Now it is time to review and
accept those changes.</p>
<p>Navigate to the issue your co-learner created in your repository. At
the very bottom of the issueâs history you will see en entry of the form
âCo-learner <span class="citation">@colearner</span> mentioned in merge
request !1 2 minutes agoâ. The merge request reference, â!1â, is a link.
We follow the link by clicking on it.</p>
<p>This leads us to the merge request page, very similar to the page of
our own merge request. The difference, that we are interested in, is the
state of the button labeled âMergeâ. The button is no longer disabled.
Above the button is a line of text that informs us that one commit and
one merge commit will be added to branch âmainâ.</p>
<p>The merge commit serves as a common descendant of the heads of your
main branch and the branch on which your co-learner based their merge
request.</p>
<p>We click on the button labeled âMergeâ. After a few seconds the box
that allowed us to merge is replaced by a box that informs us about the
successful merge.</p>
<p>In particular, there still is a sentence informing us that the merge
request mentions an issue. Our intention was for that issue to be
closed, so we click on the issue reference, for example â#1â, to
check.</p>
<p>On the issue page, we can see that indeed the issue was closed. The
last entry in the issueâs history reads similar to âCo-learner closed
via commit abcdef12 just nowâ, informing us why the issue was
closed.</p>

<p>We have setup our project, collaborated with our colleagues; we fill
our research diary every day. Now it is time to make use of it.</p>
<p>We want to share it with the world, because what we do is so
important and everyone should now about it. So we want to create a
website based on the diary and update it whenever our Markdown files
change. But we do not want to do that by hand. Instead, we are going to
let GitLab automatically turn our Markdown files into HTML, whenever our
repository changes. To achieve it, we will use two GitLab features:
CI/CD-Pipelines and Pages.</p>

Deployment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#cicd-or-continuous-integrationcontinuous-deployment"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The terms continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD)
come from the fields of software engineering and software operation.</p>
<p>A software project uses CI, if it has setup a process that
automatically runs some (or all) tests for a software project, whenever
changes are committed to the main branch of a repository or even just
proposed (for example through a merge request). In particular, when
tests are already run for proposed changes this can help prevent bugs to
reach the code base, while freeing the developer from remembering to run
all the tests, before creating a merge request.</p>
<p>CD is a process that updates the software on the production machines
(deploys) as soon as a new change reaches the code base, generally after
having passed the CI process.</p>
<p>Both processes can be implemented by running scripts, called jobs on
GitLab, triggered either by changes to the code base, the creating of
merge request, or by the successful completion of other jobs, which lead
to the CI/CD feature of GitLab.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To configure our automatic process, we navigate to our project page
and click the menu item labeled âPipelinesâ in the submenu âBuildâ of
the main menu on the left.</p>
<p>The page that this leads to invites us to âuse a sample
<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> template file to explore how CI/CD works.â
The GitLab CI is configured by providing a file called
<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> in the root directory of a projectâs
repository. Even though we want to learn how to configure CI in GitLab,
we do not follow the invitation, because the example is quite elaborate
and targets software developers specifically. Instead, we will use the
provided template for Bash.</p>
<p>In the list at the bottom of the page, we click on the button labeled
âUse templateâ in the entry for Bash.</p>
<p>This leads us to an editor for the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file
that is prepopulated with the selected template. The file is expected to
be written in the <a href="https://yaml.org/" class="external-link">YAML</a> file format,
hence the file extension <code>.yml</code>. We will go through the
example line by line. Afterwards we will adapt it to our needs.</p>
<p>The first few lines, starting with the symbol <code>#</code>, are
comments notifying us of where to find further information. The last of
these lines is the exception, which is a comment on the first functional
line:</p>

</div>
<p>This line states that the scripts that are provided later on should
be executed in Docker containers build from the stated Docker image.
Busybox is a very small Linux distribution, reduced to the bare minimum,
that provides bash, a shell.</p>

<p>It is followed by two blocks starting with
<code>before_script:</code> and <code>after_script:</code>. We will
ignore those.</p>
<p>The remaining four blocks, <code>build1:</code>, <code>test1:</code>,
<code>test2:</code>, and <code>deploy1:</code>, each define a so called
<strong>job</strong>. A job represents one non-divisible unit of a CI/CD
process. Together the jobs defined in a projectâs
<code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> file form a so called
<strong>pipeline</strong>.</p>
<p>By default a pipeline in GitLab has three <strong>stages</strong>,
called <code>build</code>, <code>test</code>, and <code>deploy</code>,
and their order is important. The terminology comes again from software
development. A pipeline is executed by running all jobs of the first
stage and, if they succeed, to then continue with jobs of the next
stage, repeating this until a job fails or all stages complete.</p>
<p>The four jobs in the example are named similar to the stages they are
assigned to. The assignment is done through the keyword
<code>stage:</code> that can in this example be found in the second line
of each jobâs definition.</p>
<p>The lines following the keyword <code>script:</code> in each section,
define the script that will be executed as part of the respective job.
In this example, they are all <code>echo</code> statements, that output
what follows.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We will now adapt the script to our requirements.</p>
<p>First we delete everything.</p>
<p>Then we define our own stages, because we do not develop software and
want to have descriptive names for our use case:</p>

</div>
<p>In the first stage, we will do some testing, in the second we will
create the HTML version of our diary and publish it.</p>
<p>We call the first job <code>check-for-mds</code> and in it make sure,
that at least one Markdown file exists, because otherwise someone must
have accidentally removed them all.</p>

</div>
<p>We use the docker image <code>bash</code>, because Bash provides the
<code>compgen</code> command that allows us to check for the existence
of files. We also state that the job belongs to the stage
<code>check</code>. Finally, we provide the script. It tests for the
existence of any files with names ending in <code>.md</code>.</p>
<p>Whenever the job <code>check-for-mds</code> successfully completes,
we want to create the HTML version of our research diary. We define a
second job and call it <code>publish-on-web</code>.</p>

</div>
<p>After giving the name of the job, we again provide an Docker image in
which the job should run. We use pandoc to convert our Markdown files
into an HTML file, so we use the official pandoc Docker image. The next
line, with the keyword <code>entrypoint</code> is necessary, because the
pandoc Docker image is configured to directly run pandoc, when started
in a container (pandoc is configured as its entrypoint). However, GitLab
CI expects to runs the provided scripts in a shell in the specified
Docker images.</p>
<div id="pandoc" class="callout callout">

<div id="pandoc" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Pandoc<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pandoc"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Pandoc converts text documents from one format to another, for
example from Markdown to HTML. It supports many formats for the source
documents and even more for the target document.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">project webpage</a> provides a
complete list (in text and graphical form).</p>
<p>The conversion is customizeable, for example through templates.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next, we specify the stage, followed by the script. It runs pandoc on
all files ending in <code>.md</code> in the current directory and
instructs it to output a file <code>diary.html</code>. Pandoc deduces
from the file extension that it should be in HTML format.</p>
<p>The final three lines, starting with the keyword
<code>artifacts</code>, specify that GitLab CI should save the file
<code>diary.html</code> from the Docker container the job runs in and
provide it for download on its web interface.</p>
<p>This completes our GitLab CI configuration. There are a lot more
configuration options, for example to have a process run only for
commits to certain branches, that are documented in <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html" class="external-link">GitLabâs
Handbook</a></p>
<p>We change the commit message to âConfigure CIâ, leave the branch as
it is (<code>main</code>), and click the button labeled âCommit
changesâ.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>The software that runs CI jobs is called a runner. GitLab provides so
called shared runners on its platform for free (within certain usage
limits). It does, however, require the user to provide credit card
information. This is intended to prevent abuse of the free resource.</p>
<p>If no such information has been provided running the CI will always
fail.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the organizers of a course based on this material
could setup their own runner and help learners to configure their
projects to use that runner.</p>
<p>On other instances the situation can be different.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Clicking the button does not cause a change in page. Instead, we are
informed at the top of the page about the status of the pipeline run
that was initiated by committing the <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> to the
repository.</p>
<p>To get a better overview, we click the menu item labeled âPipelinesâ
in the submenu âBuildâ of the main menu on the left. This brings us to
the list of pipeline runs. We should see exactly one entry in the list,
as we have just configured the CI.</p>
<p>A blue, red, or green box in the âStatusâ column informs on the left
informs us about the state of the pipeline. Blue indicates a running
pipeline, red a failed pipeline, and green a pipeline that successfully
completed. Below the status box we have the runtime of the pipeline and
below that information about when it was started.</p>
<p>In the âPipelineâ column, we see the first line of the commit that
triggered the pipeline run, the number of the pipeline run, for example
<code>#11071</code>, the branch the commit is part of as well as the
short identifier of the commit. Most of these serve as links to pages
for their respective entities.</p>
<p>The âCreated Byâ column tells us who caused the pipeline run. In our
case thatâs the author of the commit.</p>
<p>The âStagesâ column visualizes the stages and their state. In
addition to the colors discussed above, there can be stages colored in
gray. They are waiting for their predecessor stages (or need to be
manually triggered, if configured that way).</p>
<p>We wait until our pipeline ran through. It should complete without
error.</p>

<p>We click on the button labeled by the three dots on the right of the

download artifacts of the pipeline. We click on the link labeled
âpublish-on-web:archiveâ, which causes our browser to download a file
called <code>artifacts.zip</code>.</p>
<p>In that archive, we find the file <code>diary.html</code> that was
build by our second job, <code>publish-on-web</code>.</p>
<p>By opening the file in your browser, you can verify that it contains
the contents of all Markdown our files. (We ignore the fact, that the
order might not make sense at all. For that we would need to improve the
script that builds the HTML file.)</p>

<p>So far we managed to create an HTML page from our Markdown files. But
we wanted to publish it on the web.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we can use a feature of GitLab called Pages. It
allows us to publish the results of a specific job of a CI pipeline to
the web under the <code>gitlab.io</code> domain.</p>

<p>We change the job name to <code>pages</code>. This name is a
convention to tell GitLab, that we want this job to create the contents
for our web page. Then we create the HTML file in a directory called
<code>public</code> and change the path that defines the job artifacts
to <code>public</code> as well. The directory <code>public</code> is,
again by convention, the place from which GitLab will take the contents
to be published.</p>
<p>We enter the commit message âSetup GitLab-Page publicationâ and click
on âCommit changesâ. Afterwards change, the pipeline will automatically
run.</p>
<p>When it has successfully completed, we select âPagesâ under the
âDeployâ submenu of the menu on the left. In the section called âAccess
pagesâ, we find a link to the base path of our web page. This will lead
to a page informing us that the requested resource was not found. The
reason is, that we do not provide a file called <code>index.html</code>.
Instead, we need to append <code>/diary.html</code> at the end of the
URL shown in the settings page. Now we see the rendered version of that
diary, published in the web.</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
  </script>
